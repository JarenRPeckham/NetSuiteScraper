Electronic Invoicing (general availability),Electronic Invoicing (general availability),<p>Operational complexity and risk continue to intensify as organizations grow globally and expand their footprints across regions. Maintaining compliance and adapting to frequently changing regulations is a growing challenge and is particularly important when it comes to invoicing. Invoicing has traditionally been expensive and prone to errors as companies rely on paper documents and manually intensive processes. However to reduce costs and speed up the end-to-end process organizations have begun to move away from paper invoices. Moreover governments are increasingly turning to electronic invoicing as a key component of tax digitalization.By requiring organizations to digitally submit real-time tax information to tax authorities governments are able to minimize tax evasion and manipulation and reduce fraud. Whether you are in the public or private sector electronic invoicing is growing in importance and the world is shifting to paperless document processing. Without implementing electronic invoicing you risk compliance issues unnecessary costs and lagging behind your competitors.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>You can use Electronic Invoicing when you create and send electronic documents.

Global Inventory Accounting Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management,Global Inventory Accounting Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management,<p>This feature provides a comprehensive solution that enables organizations (especially international organizations) to perform inventory accounting using multiple costing ledgers thereby enabling them to comply with multiple accounting standards and internal management accounting at the same time.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Organizations especially those with international operations often prefer to account for inventory by standard cost as part of their management accounting setup. However local governments tax authorities and the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS) typically don't recognize standard cost as an accounting principle and often require average or specific identification. In addition organizations often want to account inventory using both a local currency and the functional currency.Collectively these requirements must be addressed in a comprehensive solution that supports the ability to perform inventory accounting in multiple costing ledgers where each ledger can be configured with a specific set of accounting policies.With this new functionality customers can define as many costing ledgers as required. Inventory accounting in dual currencies and in dual valuations are both supported.Inventory accounting is performed in individual ledgers. Several costing ledgers can be created for each legal entity in an organization as needed thereby ensuring that multiple inventory representations can be obtained. All documents (such as purchase orders sales orders transfer orders and so on) posted in a legal entity will be accounted in all the costing ledgers associated with the legal entity.A costing ledger is defined by:CalendarCurrencyExchange rate tableConventionA convention is a collection of inventory accounting policies that can be associated to one or more ledgers. This provides the ability to share a common convention in the organization.The Global Inventory Accounting Add-in supports multiple inventory accounting policies. For each policy a single rule can be selected and it applies to all products.Cost object policy options:ProductProduct  SiteProduct  Site  WarehouseInput measurement basis policy options:Normal historicalStandardCost flow assumption policy options:AverageSpecific identification (batch)Cost element policyRecording interval:PerpetualLastly this solution provides reports and a detailed audit trail that starts from an inventory accounting event or measurement and continues all the way back to the original document posted in Supply Chain Management.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/global-inventory-accounting-add-in-dynamics-365-supply-chain-management,,,,

These events along with associated data will be tracked in a queue which external equipment can access by web service. The data associated with each transaction is completely user configurable. Up to 10 fields can be specified to accompany each queue record. The status of each record will be tracked from blocked through sent.Similarly an inbound queue exists that external equipment can populate via web service. When the inbound queue records are consumed warehouse actions such as work completion and license plate receiving will be triggered.  Work can be executed one work line at a time or a pick/put pair can be executed in a single transaction. Short pick and location override are also supported.This new functionality will also address some refactoring to cater for performance and scale a new data model and other needed design enhancements compared to the licensed MHAX solution that was previously released for selected existing customers.See alsoMaterial handling equipment interface (MHAX) (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/integration-framework-material-handling-equipment-automated-warehouse-processes-previously-mhax,,,,
Landed cost,Landed cost,<p>This feature enables organizations to increase supply chain visibility and maximize item profitability. Landed cost provides the ability to define shipments of inbound orders and track goods in transit throughout their journey. It also provides the power to calculate item costs associated with procurement and transportation based on a rich set of allocation rules.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>The landed cost module enables you to define and track each segment of the goods-in-transit journey beginning at the supplier's warehouse and continuing to the shipping dock through the freight forwarder to a landing dock and freight company and eventually to the destination warehouse. With this visibility arrivals are predictable and warehouse planning and efficiency are improved.Landed cost can streamline the receiving processes. Shipments of inbound orders such as purchase orders or transfer orders can be defined and organized into various transportation legs. Legs can be defined by supplier shipping dock freight forwarder landing dock freight company and more. Landed cost features can be used to track and trace the containers in the shipment while in transit and receive them upon arrival into the warehouse. This enhances customer service by providing clarity to internal sales customer service and logistics stakeholders. It also provides immediate visibility of stock delays that might impact customer deliveries.Landed cost helps organizations predict item costs thereby improving pricing decision making. Automatic cost calculations can be configured for various transportation modes duties and other fees incurred to get a product to the warehouse. The costs and allocation methods can be further defined on various levels including overall shipment by container for the purchase order purchase order line or transfer order line. The estimated costs are defined as landed cost for a collection of inbound orders planned and received from a supplier in a single shipment. Based on the estimated cost purchase accruals can be recorded long before the goods are received. Later when the actual freight and other handling bills arrive the estimated costs are adjusted to reflect the actual cost amounts.Landed cost also reduces administration and costing errors. When using the standard costing method a reviewed and updated cost can be required in addition to the standard cost for specific items. Landed cost can be used to simulate shipping scenarios to predict a standard cost price for an item. By using the estimated cost definitions or a cost entered per simulation scenario the system can predict costs allocated to items within a simulated shipment.

Store commerce app with Chromium rendering engine and integrated hardware support,Store commerce app with Chromium rendering engine and integrated hardware support,<p>The Store commerce app is a shell app for Windows that uses Microsoft Edge WebView2 to render the Cloud Point of Sale (CPOS). CPOS can currently run only in a web browser but the Store commerce app can run as a native Windows app like Modern Point of Sale (MPOS). A local hardware station can be directly integrated to the payment terminal printer or cash drawer. There's no need to set up a shared hardware station to use hardware devices.Store commerce uses the Chromium engine to render the user interface instead of Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app rendering. The key difference between MPOS and the Store commerce app is the Store commerce app uses the Chromium engine to render.The Store commerce app will replace MPOS in the future when it has full functional parity with MPOS. The Store commerce app currently doesnt support offline mode (when there is no connectivity to Retail Server) but MPOS does. Customers who dont need offline support can use this app with a dedicated or shared hardware station.The Store commerce app will be published in Microsoft Store for easier discovery download and deployment simplifying the app lifecycle management for deployment and servicing.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Some of the benefits of the Store commerce app are:It supports rich commerce functionality for all first-line workers such as cashiers sales and inventory associates stock clerks and store managers.Its deployed in Microsoft Store for better app lifecycle management support.It supports local hardware station.It uses the new Chromium engine for rendering the UWP app.See alsoStore Commerce app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce (Preview) (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/store-commerce-app-chromium-rendering-engine-integrated-hardware-support,,,,
B2B e-commerce,B2B e-commerce,<p>The global e-commerce industry has been experiencing rapid growth during the last two decades and with growth comes change. The opportunity for business-to-business (B2B) sales has seemingly received significantly less attention possibly due to the millions of entrepreneurs competing for business in the business-to-consumer (B2C) market.The data reflects that the tremendous potential for B2B e-commerce cant be ignored for long though. B2B e-commerce transactions in the United States have grown 40 percent from $559 billion in 2013 to $780 billion by end of 2015. In 2018 alone B2B e-commerce sales in the United States were estimated to exceed $1 trillion with continuous forecasted growth according to Forrester Research.Furthermore 74 percent of B2B buyers research online and 30 percent buy at least one-half of their work purchases online. Manufacturers distributors and wholesalers alike are investing heavily in next-generation enterprise B2B commerce technology to ensure they are delivering world-class online buying experiences that can scale for anticipated growth. As a result of this wave of investment manufacturing and wholesale trade firms will spend more on commerce technology by the end of the decade than their peers in B2C retail.As e-business teams look for solutions in the market not only are they benchmarking their future-state online buying experience against B2B peers but also against B2C leaders. They need solutions with a best-in-class foundation of B2C features such as robust marketing and merchandising and experience management tools. Unique B2B capabilities such as contract pricing quotes pricing lists e-procurement product configuration and customization guided selling bulk order entry and account contract and budget management can then be layered on top.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>As a part of our B2B e-commerce initial offering the following capabilities will be enabled:Business partner onboardingOrder templatesQuantity thresholds (minimum maximum multiple)On account payment methodSalesperson for business partnerAccount statement and invoice printingPayment of sales invoiceQuick order entryDynamics 365 Sales integrationSee alsoSet up a B2B e-commerce site (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/b2b-e-commerce,,,,

Create discounts that apply after all other periodic discounts are applied,Create discounts that apply after all other periodic discounts are applied,<p>Very often retailers want to quickly create new promotions on certain items to match prices with their competitors or meet their sales targets. This new feature allows discounts to be applied after all the existing discounts are applied enabling that scenario.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Without this feature if a retailer wants to create a discount that gets compounded with the existing discounts the retailer needs to create a new discount with the discount concurrency mode configured as &quot;Compounded.&quot; Given that there could be other existing discounts on an item that are marked as &quot;Exclusive&quot; or &quot;Best price&quot; however there is no guarantee that this new discount will apply on all the items.With this feature we enabled a new discount concurrency mode called  &quot;Always apply&quot; that will be available for simple discounts and threshold discounts. All the discounts that are created using the &quot;Always apply&quot; mode will get applied on the appropriate items after all the existing periodic discounts are applied. That means they will apply to the exclusive and best price discounts as well. The discounts will apply before manual discounts though such as cashier-added discounts.See alsoDiscount prioritization (learn)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/create-discounts-that-apply-after-all-other-periodic-discounts-are-applied,,,,
Archive credit card transaction data,Archive credit card transaction data,<p>Credit card response data can take up a lot of space in a database. Because this data is mostly needed for performing linked refunds the usefulness of the data decreases dramatically after the business refund policy for a transaction expires. This feature introduces a job that will automatically archive credit card data when it can no longer be used for linked refunds according to business policy thus ensuring that only critical data is kept for day-to-day operations.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>This feature introduces a job that can be set up to archive credit card XML authorization response data that's a specific age as configured by the business user. When credit card data reaches the configured age the job will put the data in a .zip file and export it using document management. Once the data is exported it can't be restored programmatically. This is important because the authorization data subject to export is required for linked refunds so only data older than the linked refund window detailed in the businesses return policy should be subject to export.See alsoArchive credit card transaction data (docs)Data distribution (learn)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/archive-credit-card-transaction-data,,,,

Exclusive threshold discounts compete with exclusive non-threshold periodic discounts,Exclusive threshold discounts compete with exclusive non-threshold periodic discounts,<p>The most common use case of threshold discounts is to give additional discounts if the customer meets the defined threshold. Dynamics 365 Commerce supports this capability as the threshold discounts are always evaluated after the simple quantity and mix and match discounts have been evaluated. In other words a threshold discount does not compete with any of the other periodic discounts. However sometimes retailers want the threshold discount to compete with other discounts so that the best discount gets applied.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>With this feature retailers will be able to turn on a configuration that will ensure the exclusive threshold discounts compete with the other exclusive non-threshold discounts to offer the best price.See alsoRetail discount types (learn)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/exclusive-threshold-discounts-compete-exclusive-non-threshold-periodic-discounts,,,,
Omnichannel support for incremental payment capture,Omnichannel support for incremental payment capture,<p>This feature brings full incremental capture support for orders fulfilled over multiple invoices. Prior to this feature each time the remaining balance for an order was updated a new credit card authorization was obtained for the remaining amount due. This feature adds the ability to create one authorization per order. Each time a shipment for that order is invoiced the payment will be captured against the original payment authorization and the authorization will remain open and used for future payment captures. This ensures that orders fulfilled over time do not result in authorizations over the order amount and also reduces the chance of future authorizations being declined.This feature will help with customer satisfaction because orders fulfilled within a reasonable timeframe will no longer be subject to multiple authorizations. In addition fewer authorizations per order means lower processing fees and fewer cases where the remaining balance on an order cannot be authorized.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Incremental capture adds the ability to fulfill an order over time using a single payment authorization. For example a customer might have an order that is fulfilled over three shipments. Without this feature each time a shipment is invoiced payment will be captured for the amount invoiced and a new authorization will be created for the remainder. In this scenario three authorizations are needed over the course of order fulfillment. This can lead to cases where authorizations exceed the total amount of the order or declines due to authorizations exceeding open credit available for cardholders.When this feature is enabled payments for orders fulfilled from the distribution centers or stores will reference the original authorization as long as it is valid. The result will be fewer declines less customer confusion and easier reconciliation of payments and invoices.This feature is supported by the out-of-the-box Adyen payment connector and can be implemented for third-party payment connectors.See alsoIncremental capture for order invoicing (docs)Omnichannel support for incremental payment capture (learn)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/omni-channel-support-incremental-payment-capture,,,,
Simplified Commerce SDK update and developer experience,Simplified Commerce SDK update and developer experience,<p>Dynamics 365 Commerce SDK updates are published in Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services and the SDK can be applied to all the dev environment using the Lifecycle Services workflow or through a manual process. The process takes a few hours and needs to be repeated for all monthly updates. With the new approach all of the SDK updates will be published to a public NuGet and GitHub repository so that updates can be downloaded and applied to the environment in minutes. This approach saves time and effort for developers.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Extension development: Commerce SDK development can be done mostly from the developer virtual machine (VM) available in Lifecycle Services. If it's hosted in the cloud though additional cost is incurred. To reduce the cost and the Lifecycle Services development VM dependency the Commerce development experience will be decoupled from the Lifecycle Services developer VM and development will be supported outside of the developer VM. Development can be done on any development machine that supports the Commerce development environment configurations.Commerce SDK reference to NuGet: Commerce SDK references will be refactored and published to a new NuGet feed for extensions to consume. Instead of manually referring the binaries in Commerce SDK\Reference folder the extension can download it from the NuGet package and the package can be easily updated to the latest available version using the NuGet package manager workflow.Commerce SDK samples to GitHub: All the Commerce SDK samples will be published to a public GitHub repository for extensions to refer and learn how to customize the Dynamics 365 Commerce solution to support custom business processes.

Independent deployment and installation packages for MPOS CPOS HWS and CSU extensions,Independent deployment and installation packages for MPOS CPOS HWS and CSU extensions,<p>The current extension packaging model requires extensions and core application code to be packaged together to apply a hotfix or to upgrade. This requires more effort because merge and repackaging are required each time a hotfix or upgrade is applied. Also if the Commerce components are customized the same process must be repeated for every hotfix. This limits the continuous integration and continuous deployment process. New independent deployment and installation packages for Modern POS (MPOS) Cloud POS (CPOS) Cloud Scale Unit (CSU) and Hardware Station (HWS) will eliminate the merging and repackaging effort. The feature also allows users to independently package manually deploy and service the extensions and core separately.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>The new independent packaging feature separates extensions from the core and provides options to create extension-only packages that can be independently installed and serviced. The core installer framework is completely redesigned to separate the core and extension installer. MPOS CPOS development and packaging framework is also enhanced to support this independent package and installation model by inheriting the Windows optional package Desktop Bridge and MSIX technologies. To support this new extension framework the MPOS CPOS and packaging models will be updated with a new extension template UI controls packaging and deployment tools.With this new model all MPOS extensions will be created as separate APPX files and core POS will load these APPX files as add-ins. The add-ins (extensions APPX) will run under the context core MPOS app identity. Previously the core POS and extensions were packaged as one APPX but now there will be one core APPX and one extensions APPX to support independent installation and servicing. The extension APPX will not be able to run by itself. It will be loaded only by the core APPX. To migrate the old MPOS extension to this new model migrate the code to the new extension template. This might require some code refactoring to support the new UI controls and framework.The HWS and CSU installer framework is redesigned to create installers that can contain only the extension components. With the new installers HWS and CSU can be independently serviced for both extensions and out-of-the-box components.NoteThis feature includes only the development and creation of an extension package. It doesn't include any Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services deployment and servicing.

Out-of-the-box support for wallet-style payment methods,Out-of-the-box support for wallet-style payment methods,<p>Modern retailers are looking to support new ways for customers to pay. In recent years wallet-style payments have exploded in market share. This feature enables out-of-the-box support for wallet payment methods through the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen or payments SDK. In addition to wallet support a new method of mapping card types configured in Commerce headquarters to electronic payments coming from payment connectors is being introduced. This new mapping allows administrators to avoid traditional BIN range mapping in favor of a user-friendly form that also makes it easy to ensure that all supported payment types are mapped to a card type in Commerce headquarters.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>This feature removes the need to have BIN range present in authorization responses and puts less dependency on card number lookup and matching during acceptance of modern payment methods. It also adds support for these payment methods in omnichannel scenarios such as buy online and pick up in store.When this feature is enabled administrators can use a form that queries payment connectors for supported payment methods and lists them in the user interface instead of using BIN range mapping. Users can then select card types configured in Commerce headquarters match them to payment methods supported by payment connectors and then save those mappings. All payment methods supported by payment connectors and not yet mapped are easy to identify thus avoiding errors that can arise from traditional BIN range mapping.See alsoWallet payment support (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/out-of-box-support-wallet-style-payment-methods,,,,
Refactored payment processing in storefront checkout,Refactored payment processing in storefront checkout,<p>This feature reduces the number of authorization requests to the payments processor resulting in lower payment processing fees. It also adds better support for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) in the European Union by combining the customer authentication by their bank with the authorization request for the amount due on the order.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>In Europe SCA requires that if a customer is paying for an online transaction using a card the website must support redirecting the customer for authentication as the cardholder directly with their bank. If the customer can be authenticated by their bank prior to the authorization request the transaction is considered more secure and the liability shifts away from the merchant. Today that customer authentication is done when the card token is obtained. That card token is then used in a subsequent authorization request. From the merchant's standpoint that subsequent authorization request does not have a liability shift because it was made using a card token or card on file. This can cause confusion for merchants using the storefront.When this feature is enabled a single request will be made to obtain the card token and authorization. The request will also include SCA redirect. The result is that merchants will see one authorization request that includes the liability shift where SCA is applicable. For merchants subject to SCA requirements and those who are not this feature will result in fewer authorization requests which translates into lower processing fees.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/refactored-payment-processing-storefront-checkout,,,,

Enhanced e-commerce product discovery to be inventory-aware,Enhanced e-commerce product discovery to be inventory-aware,<p>Customers generally expect an e-commerce site to be inventory-aware throughout the browsing experience so that they can make decisions on what to do in case of no and low inventory. Currently we offer an option to enable a product inventory check for &quot;buy box&quot; &quot;cart&quot; and &quot;store picker&quot; modules and we only allow products to be purchased if inventory is available. We'll further apply similar checks to the product discovery steps of the e-commerce shopping journey to light up the end-to-end story.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>This feature will enhance the e-commerce product search service to incorporate inventory data and provide users the ability to:Filter out out-of-stock products from product search results.Display inventory level messages on product search results pages and category product list pages.Sort product search results by inventory availability.Filter products by inventory level on refiners.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/enhanced-e-commerce-product-discovery-be-inventory-aware,,,,
Enhancements to the e-commerce inventory availability lookup APIs,Enhancements to the e-commerce inventory availability lookup APIs,<p>Dynamics 365 Commerce has provided GetEstimatedAvailability and GetEstimatedProductWarehouseAvailability APIs to support various e-commerce scenarios that require product inventory check. For example display inventory-level message on the product description page (PDP) and check inventory availability for &quot;quantity picker&quot; and &quot;store picker&quot; modules. We will continue to invest in improvements to the APIs to support more e-commerce scenarios based on in-market customer feedback and address the limitations in current APIs to eliminate customizations.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>This feature will provide the following enhancements to the GetEstimatedAvailability and GetEstimatedProductWarehouseAvailability APIs:Ability to retrieve quantity in Sell unit of measure (UoM) from the APIs. The APIs only return quantity based on Inventory UoM. For retailers who configure products to use different Inventory UoM and Sell UoM customization is required to handle unit conversion. This enhancement will provide an option in APIs to retrieve quantity based on Sell UoM.Ability to retrieve aggregated inventory data from the APIs. There are a growing number of retailers who set up their e-commerce sites to use multiple warehouses to facilitate product fulfillment. In that scenario when showing inventory level on the PDP or determining purchase eligibility based on inventory we should consider the product's on-hand inventory from all relevant warehouses rather than a single warehouse. Today the APIs only return inventory data per individual warehouse. This enhancement will provide users the ability to retrieve aggregated quantity and inventory level from the APIs based on all relevant warehouses all shipping warehouses or all pickup locations.Factor in point-of-sale (POS)-side unposted inventory changes when calculating estimated inventory. The APIs are using optimized channel-side calculation logic to surface estimated on-hand inventory. Today this calculation only factors in e-commerce transactions that haven't yet been synced to Commerce headquarters. In an omnichannel context transactions that have occurred in a retail store (such as cash-and-carry sales) might also impact the inventory availability for e-commerce sales. This enhancement will update the calculation logic to include unposted inventory sold through POS to ensure the same product in the same warehouse shows consistent estimated inventory from the online channel and POS inventory lookup page.See alsoCommerce Scale Unit customer and consumer APIs (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/enhancements-e-commerce-inventory-availability-lookup-apis,,,,

Support inventory adjustments from POS,Support inventory adjustments from POS,<p>Many retailers need the ability to adjust inventory in or out to account for standard business processes such as using store inventory for samples or other purposes where they prefer to perform an adjustment manually as opposed to a sale. Commerce point of sale (POS) now provides comprehensive in-store inventory management capabilities that are common to the majority of retail customers to eliminate the need for multiple applications in the store.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>This feature will provide an operation accessible from POS to allow an authorized user to perform an adjustment of inventory in or out depending on their business scenario. The feature will provide options that allow the use of both the movement journal and the adjustment journal concepts from Commerce headquarters to be leveraged in POS. Users will be able to link a reason code to the adjustment that will determine the journal type that will be used.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/support-inventory-adjustments-pos,,,,
Unified returns processing for POS including serial number validation,Unified returns processing for POS including serial number validation,<p>In our current in-market application there are two separate processes for posting return orders through the point of sale (POS) app. This new feature unifies the return order processing user experience so all return order types can be processed through the Return Transaction or Show Journal operations. In addition this feature brings new optional capabilities to allow the user to validate the serial numbers on serialized item returns.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>When enabling the unified return processing experience in POS users will experience an updated and unified return order processing experience.In previous versions of Dynamics 365 Commerce users had to process cash and carry returns through the Return Transaction operation and process customer order returns separately through the Recall Order operation. This experience could be confusing for users as often the user would not know which type of order they were returning and therefore did not know which operation to use. Users could sometimes return customer orders through the Return Transaction operation with what would seem like no errors but doing so would create data corruption on the order in certain scenarios.With this new feature enabled any invoiced Commerce order or order line can be returned using the Return Transaction operation. Users can also use the Show Journal operation to find a transaction and initiate a return for cash and carry or customer orders through the journal. When using the Recall order operation in POS the return function will still be limited to supporting the return of customer orders because this operation recalls only customer orders and not cash and carry.The user experience has been improved so the user has access to more information and a streamlined processing flow when selecting returnable items to add to the return transaction.The infrastructure of the returns operation has also been bolstered to better support offline return processing to allow &quot;channel side&quot; tracking of returnable quantities. That way if a real-time service call can't be made to validate returnable quantities a channel side variable still can be used to validate returnable quantities.Lastly enabling this feature also provides a new optional configuration to support validation of serial numbers on the return order. If configured the user is asked to input the serial number of the item being returned when returning a serialized item in POS. The system will then validate the input against the original sale and the user will be warned if the serial number being returned does not match the original.Enabling this feature also removes the previously configurable option for creating return merchandise authorization (RMA) orders in Commerce headquarters when returns are processed in POS. All returns will be written to Commerce headquarters as sales orders with negative sales lines and no RMA will be generated.See alsoReturn serial numbercontrolled products in POS (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/unified-returns-processing-pos-including-serial-number-validation,,,,
Prevent unintentional price calculation in the call center for Commerce orders,Prevent unintentional price calculation in the call center for Commerce orders,<p>When an order is placed in the Dynamics 365 Commerce point of sale (POS) app or through an e-commerce site the customer commits to an amount that can include a price and a discount. If the customer calls the call center later to modify the order (for example to add another item to the order) and a promotion on the existing order line is expired the customer would expect that the discount applied on the existing order line would not be removed. Further if there was no discount applied during the original order placement and the customer calls the call center to modify the order after a new promotion started the customer would expect the discount to be applied. Otherwise the customer may cancel the order and place a new one. There is therefore a need to preserve the prices and discounts committed to the customer but call center users need the flexibility to recalculate prices and discounts for sales order lines if needed.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>With this feature we provide a new property named Price locked that can be applied to all Commerce orders. The property will be checked automatically for all order lines after the order capture is complete. That way if the order is subsequently edited all the existing lines will be excluded from the pricing and discount calculation. However if the call center user wants to include the order lines in the pricing calculation the user can unselect the property for any order line and then select Recalculate.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/prevent-unintentional-price-calculation-call-center-commerce-orders,,,,

Behavioral and mobile fingerprinting,Behavioral and mobile fingerprinting,<p>Behavioral and mobile fingerprinting improves the accuracy of fraud management rules.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Fighting fraud is a never-ending challenge and we need to stay one step ahead of fraudsters. A new technology that can be very useful in fraud protection is called behavioral fingerprinting or behavioral biometrics. While device fingerprinting allows us to sense and reason over device characteristics and even uniquely identify devices behavioral telemetry can allow us to reason over signals about how a user is interacting with the portal. The signals are particularly informative when the user is relying on a mobile device or app to access the portal. Behavioral fingerprinting is closely allied to mobile fingerprinting.A broad variety of signals belong in this category ranging from typing swiping scrolling and dwelling behaviors to how a device is held and moved as detected by sensors to navigation and clicks. The goal with this functionality is not to identify a particular individual uniquely but rather to have discrimination between normal versus abnormal usage of a device or service.For example if a device shows no movement and shows a constant horizontal attitude it's unlikely that a person is interacting with the device and any activity most likely is coming from a scripted bot working on a rigged device. Similarly one can learn to discriminate between the true owner of a device and someone else who might be using it illicitly or we can sense that a device is being used by many different people over a short time indicating that it's a pony device. Behavioral fingerprinting can help improve the accuracy of AI models across all Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection capabilities.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/fraud-protection/dynamics365-fraud-protection/behavioral-mobile-fingerprinting,,,,

External calls and velocities,External calls and velocities,<p>The functionality will enable the customer to improve fraud management by using attributes like velocities as well as custom machine learning scores in rules.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Some of our biggest customers identified the availability of stateful attributes such as velocities in the rule engine as critical to their fraud strategy. We will enable the definition of custom velocities in the rules language and make them available at the execution runtime of rules.Customers also identified the ability to make external calls and consume the results in the rules engine as a feature that is needed to bring parity with their existing system. They further want to use this ability to recall scores from their custom AI models. Enabling an external call mechanism will open the doors for a wide variety of customers to use the rules engine in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection in conjunction with their custom machine learning.These needs can be satisfied by functionality that allows customers to make external calls from the rules stack. These external calls can be used to:Call a custom velocity calculation hosted in Fraud Protection.Call a custom machine learning scoring endpoint hosted in a location such as Azure Machine Learning.Orchestrate data enrichments.See alsoPerform velocity checks (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/fraud-protection/dynamics365-fraud-protection/external-calls-velocities,,,,

Improvements for the delegated administrators,Improvements for the delegated administrators,<p>Provide partner users acting as delegated administrators with additional access and capabilities to help them service their customers better.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>With this release we enable delegated administrators to perform more actions in the Business Central environment. These actions used to be only available to licensed customer users. This will enable partners to provide better support for their customers.Job queues are used in numerous business-critical scenarios in Business Central today yet our partners were unable to verify that the job queues they configured could actually run. For example they couldn't tell whether they had the required permissions or license. Setting up and testing Business Central environments before handing them over to the customers is an essential task for partners (delegated administrators).Regarding job queues partners acting as delegated administrators can now perform the following activities:Pause a job queue which was scheduled by a licensed user.Restart a failed job queue which was scheduled by a licensed user. (This feature will ship later with one of the minor updates.)Run a job queue one time for one full cycle to verify that it works. They can call it as many times as needed before handing it over to the customer (licensed user) to start it as a recurrent job. After the job queue completes it will be put in the on-hold status and can't be rescheduled.Also with this release delegated administrators can change the Business Central user experience from Essential to Premium on the Company Information page.It's common that partner users are also registered as business-to-business (B2B) guest users in the customer's Azure directoryfor example in order to collaborate via Microsoft Teams. In the past partner users invited as B2B guests would lose their delegated administration access to Business Central environments of the customer. With this release partner users that have a delegated administration relationship with the customer will keep the same access to Business Central and the Business Central admin center even if they're added as B2B guests. (This feature will ship later with one of the minor updates.)See alsoDelegated Administrator Access to Business Central Online (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/improvements-delegated-administrators,,,,
Reassign an environment from one Azure Active Directory organization to another (through Microsoft Support),Reassign an environment from one Azure Active Directory organization to another (through Microsoft Support),<p>Protect business continuity and allow customers keep their Business Central environments running in situations where their Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization layout changes.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>In some cases the Azure AD organization of a Business Central customer changes after they acquire a Business Central environment. For example this can occur if business entities merge or if an acquisition takes place or if the customer decides to use one Azure AD organization in a specific region and stop using other Azure AD organizations that they created in other regions. It also can happen if the environment was mistakenly created by the reselling partner for the wrong Azure AD organization.In all such cases the customers want to preserve the Business Central environments they created for the original Azure AD organizations and link them to the new ones instead.In this release wave we are adding a new capability to Business Central online so that Microsoft Support can reassign an environment from one Azure AD organization to another based on the partner's support request. When logging such support requests the partner must provide proof of their delegated admin rights in both Azure AD tenants as well as a confirmation from the customer that the environment move is authorized by them.See alsoMove an environment to another Azure Active Directory organization (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/reassign-environment-one-azure-active-directory-organization-another-through-support,,,,

Automatic creation of lot and serial number information cards,Automatic creation of lot and serial number information cards,<p>Some industries not only need to track lot and serial numbers they also need additional information about them. To support that Business Central offers the Lot No. Information and SN Information pages where you can add notes such as information about the quality of a lot and block the use of numbers if needed. These pages are often extended for specific industries. You can create these pages to add details directly while you create item tracking lines. Alternatively if you create lot and serial numbers in bulk you can add details automatically when you post inventory transactions.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>To create an information card when you post journals or documents go to the Item Tracking Code page and turn on the Create SN Info. on posting or Create Lot No. Info on posting toggles.

Changes in synchronization between contact and customer or vendor,Changes in synchronization between contact and customer or vendor,<p><p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>We are changing the way data is synchronized between cards for customers and vendors contacts of type Company and contacts of type Person.Business Central continues to keep in sync any customer or vendor record and contact record that are linked through the Business Relations action. Similarly we continue to propagate data from contacts of type Company to linked contacts of type Person while respecting the settings from the Marketing Setup page.New in this release wave is that the contact selected in Contact Code and Contact Name on the customer card and vendor card will no longer be used for sync. These fields contain the default contact of type Person for the specific customer or vendor to be used in documents. While you still can add a contact of type Company there is not much sense in it. We recommend using the Link to existing action from the contact card instead to register the connection between a customer or vendor and a contact of type Company. For more information see To link a contact to an existing customer vendor employee or bank account.Note that fields on the Address &amp; Contact FastTab of the customer card are related to the customer not the contact person.  They'll no longer be updated when you choose a new contact in the Contact Code or Contact Name fields. The same applies to the fields on the vendor card.After all in most cases you wouldnt want Business Central to copy private email from the specified contact of type Person to the customer or vendor and then synch it to the contact of type Company or to other contacts of type Person that are linked to the same company.To highlight this new behavior we reorganized fields on the Address &amp; Contact FastTab on the customer card and vendor card isolating the Contact Code and Contact Name in a separate group.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/changes-synchronization-between-contact-customer,,,,

Monitor inventory and transaction flow with Availability by Lot window,Monitor inventory and transaction flow with Availability by Lot window,<p><p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>As the flow of goods in a supply chain becomes more complex the ability to keep track of items is increasingly important. In fact for some companies such as those in the medical and chemical supply space monitoring an item's transaction flow is a legal requirement. Other businesses might want to monitor products with warranties or expiration dates for customer service reasons.Business Central makes it easy to handle serial and lot numbers for items so you can quickly determine when and where items were received where they're stored and when and where they were sold. In this release we've improved the item tracking capabilities by introducing Availability by Lot. You now have a list of lots with on-hand quantities plus expected incoming and outgoing transactions such as sales purchase transfer assembly or production orders.If you enable Lot Specific Tracking for an item tracking code you can get an overview of quantities by opening the Availability by Lot page from the item card or item list. To be sure that the quantities match in other pages related to availability such as the Availability by Variant Availability by Location and Availability by Date pages you must specify tracking information for expected incoming or outgoing transactions.

More control over settings for Default Dimensions,More control over settings for Default Dimensions,<p>Consistent and accurate dimension value attributes on operational and financial transactions ensures great insights from business data in Business Central. With this feature your controllers and finance and accounting users have greater control over prerequisites for recording any transaction that must include dimension value attributes that will later be used in business analysis and reporting.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Instead of allowing users to pick just any dimension value when the dimension Value Posting is set to Code Mandatory using Allowed Dimension Values in the Default Dimensions page users can now pick from a predefined list of allowed dimension values that controlling finance or accounting departments choose as valid for particular master data documents or transaction posting in Business Central.For example your company wants to track customer revenue by geography using the AREA dimension as shown in this example in the Business Central documentation. Your finance department sets all customer revenue transactions to include an AREA dimension value by choosing Code Mandatory in the AREA dimension's Value Posting column in the Default Dimensions page.Continuing the example you have a customer that has operations both in North and South America but not in the Pacific area. For such customers you choose Code Mandatory in AREA dimension's Value Posting column in the Default Dimensions page and then in the Allowed Dimension Values field you choose North America and South America only.This way Business Central checks the dimensions values and requires the order processor to specify an AREA dimension value and that the dimension values that the order processor picks are either North America or South America when they post sales invoices and other transactions for this customer.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Edit active prices in Prices Overview and implement price changes using Price Worksheet,Edit active prices in Prices Overview and implement price changes using Price Worksheet,<p>Almost every business has its own approach to pricing its products or services. Some use price lists that apply to specific groups of customers and some just rely on sales prices. Therefore Business Central provides flexibility in defining and updating prices and price lists using prices overviews and worksheets.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>When you enable the New Pricing Experience feature update on the Feature Management page the Feature Data Update guide opens. To specify that you primarily work with sales prices turn on the Use default prices toggle. If you use sales price lists turn off the toggle.If Use default price lists is turned on during feature data update existing prices will be converted to default price lists for each area (sales purchase and jobs). This lets you edit prices in the same way as before. The default price lists will be automatically specified on the Sales &amp; Receivables Setup Purchases &amp; Payables Setup and Jobs Setup pages.NoteIf prices are set only on item or resource cards the default price lists will not include those prices during feature data update. However you can open any of the default price lists and use the Suggest Lines action to add the prices from the item or resource cards. Also if you already enabled New Pricing Experience you can create default price lists manually or use one of your existing price lists as default. To make an existing price list the default turn on the Allow Updating Defaults toggle and in one of the setup pagesfor example Sales &amp; Receivables Setupchoose this price list as the Default Sales Price List.If Use default price lists is turned off existing prices will be converted to new price lists according to what they apply to what starting and ending dates they have currencies units of measure and the minimum quantity.When you turn on the Allow Editing Active Price toggle on the Sales &amp; Receivables Setup and Purchase &amp; Payables Setup pages you can edit prices on active price lists in the context of the selected item resource customer or vendor. When the toggle is turned off to update prices in a price list you must change the status of the price list to Draft make your change and then activate the price list.The Prices Overview page provides an overview of prices across all price lists. You can set filters that will narrow down the list of prices to modify or add to. When you're done modifying prices you can choose Verify Lines to verify prices against other price list lines to avoid duplicates and ambiguity during price calculation.NoteWhen you edit a line in an active price list the status of the line becomes Draft and the line will not be considered during price calculation until you use the Verify lines action. After you verify the price the line's status becomes Active and it will be considered in price calculations.To add new prices use the Add New Lines action on the Prices Overview page. This opens the Prices Worksheet page where you can add one or more price lines either by suggesting them based on criteria copying them from other price lists or manually entering them.After you enter new prices on the Prices Worksheet page you can compare them to existing prices before you implement the changes. Choosing the Implement Price Change action verifies prices against other price lists to avoid duplicates and ambiguity during price calculation.NoteYou need to have the Feature Update: New sales pricing experience feature enabled in Feature Management to use this capability.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Dimension issues detection and repair tool,Dimension issues detection and repair tool,<p>Some businesses migrate dimension data by importing configuration packages or using a customization to generate the data. If something goes wrong businesses need a way to detect and fix issues to ensure that their business reports are accurate and consistent.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Sometimes businesses use configuration packages to import data for dimensions or run custom code to generate the data. If these processes are performed without running validation triggers the result can be an incorrect value in the Shortcut Dimension No. field on the Dimension Set Entry table. The incorrect value can make reports that use dimension data to be inaccurate or cause issues when displaying values for shortcut dimensions on various pages.Business Central can now detect the incorrect values in places where this can cause an issue such as in recurring general journals and display the errors on the Error Messages page. In addition to listing the issues the Error Messages page also offers a link to the Update Global Dimension No. for Dimension Set Entries report which makes it easy to fix them in just a few steps.The Update Global Dimension No. for Dimension Set Entries report fixes the value in the Shortcut Dimension No. field on the Dimension Set Entry table. Because the Dimension Set Entry table can contain a lot of entries it might take time to resolve the issues so we recommend that you schedule the report to run outside of business hours.To preserve the audit trail for the changes that the Update Global Dimension No. for Dimension Set Entries report makes Business Central will always log the previous and new values of the Shortcut Dimension No. field and you can view them on the Change Log Entries page.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Usability enhancements for the Business Central web client,Usability enhancements for the Business Central web client,<p><p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Navigate to related records from non-list fieldsIn 2020 release wave 1 the web client was enhanced by hyperlinking any non-editable field on a list page that relates to another record. This helps users quickly access related fields or drill down to the details of the related record.In this release wave we're expanding this behavior to also apply to any non-editable field on any page such as card pages or the header and footer on document pages.Double-click a record in a listLists of records now accept double-clicking as a quick way to activate a single record. This is consistently available when viewing the list as rows or even as tiles.Even though you can now double-click in the empty space between record values you can continue to single-click on any hyperlinked values to activate them. Or click repeatedly on non-hyperlinked values to select and then copy the text.A double-click triggers the default action for the record. For example on most lists this would drill down into the details card page for the record. In a lookup dialog box this would instead choose the record and close the dialog.Consistently select all text when clicking on a fieldToday using the Tab or Enter keys to set focus on a field or selecting an editable cell in a list always selects the entire field value. This is convenient for quickly replacing the field value. With this update we are aligning the remaining cases that didn't select the entire field value with a single click so that they now do.Working at reduced browser width or upscaled screensWe've made the desktop interface more responsive where it adapts automatically to the available space. This accommodates diverse screen resolutions low-vision users who are more comfortable working with a scaled-up UI as well as embedding the Business Central web client into small frames inside other applications. Enhancements include:Page inspection pane can be collapsed to the side of the screen.Horizontal scrollbar added to fixed layout and grid layout controls to prevent compressing tabular values.Action buttons on report request pages and all dialogs are always visible and accessible.Report preview stretches to fill the available space and toolbar buttons remain visible and accessible.At reduced width page margins automatically shrink to display more content.Buttons and menus in the Business Central header remain accessible.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Return record link instead of name when using lookups,Return record link instead of name when using lookups,<p>A common application scenario when typing in information is to allow a user to pick an entity based on find-as-you-type.

Additional dimensions in Item Tracking as foundation for vertical solutions,Additional dimensions in Item Tracking as foundation for vertical solutions,<p>With 2021 release wave 1 we introduce Package No. support for a third dimension for item tracking that you can use as is to keep track of simple WMS packages or pallets or which you can use as a foundation for advanced vertical solutions.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>For business usersEnable Feature Update: Use tracking by package number in reservation and tracking system on the Feature Management page to activate this functionality and make fields and actions visible.Specify exactly how you want to track items on the Item Tracking Code page in the Package section. It follows the same principles and limitations as lot tracking.Choose the Package Caption field on the Inventory Setup page to replace the default term package with another that better fits your processes such as Container License Plate or Pallet.For ISV developersHere is the list of changes and possibilities for extension in the Item Tracking area with recommendations for developers:The item tracking code now relies on the new Item Tracking Setup table instead of the Serial/Lot Nos table. Extend the new table with additional fields if you want to pass additional parameters.The Package No. field was added to various item tracking tables including Tracking Specification Reservation Entry and Item Ledger Entry. See the full list of item tracking-enabled tables below.All business logic for package tracking is implemented with a subscriber model as you can see in the Package Management codeunit.Use OnAfter events such as OnAfterCopyTrackingFrom OnAfterSetTrackingFilterFrom and OnAfterTrackingExist in tracking-related tables to add your code in subscribers.CaptionClass 6X allows user-defined captions and is added to all package tracking fields. Remember to use it with fields that you add with your solution.Visibility of package tracking fields and actions is managed by the feature key PackageTracking. Use the procedure PackageManagement.IsEnabled() to check and manage the visibility of package fields programmatically.The Custom Declaration feature from Russian localization was reworked to use package tracking and is now implemented as the Custom Declaration Tracking extension. Take a look at it if you need a real-life sample for a tracking solution that is based on package tracking. Find the extension on the product media for the Russian version.Add more fields to the Package No. Information for advanced solutions such as for quality management.Item tracking tablesHere are the tables in the base application where the item tracking fields Serial No. Lot No. and Package No. have been added:BinContent.Table.alBinContentBuffer.Table.alEntrySummary.Table.alInventoryBuffer.Table.alInventoryProfile.Table.alItem.Table.alItemEntryRelation.Table.alItemJournalLine.Table.alItemLedgerEntry.Table.alItemTracingBuffer.Table.alItemTrackingCode.Table.alItemTrackingSetup.Table.alJobJournalLine.Table.alJobLedgerEntry.Table.alJobPlanningLine.Table.alPostedInvtPickLine.Table.alPostedInvtPutawayLine.Table.alPostedWhseReceiptLine.Table.alRecordBuffer.Table.alRegisteredInvtMovementLine.Table.alRegisteredWhseActivityLine.Table.alReservationEntry.Table.alTrackingSpecification.Table.alWarehouseActivityLine.Table.alWarehouseEntry.Table.alWarehouseJournalLine.Table.alWhseItemEntryRelation.Table.alWhseItemTrackingLine.Table.alSee alsoTrack Items with Serial Lot and Package Numbers (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/additional-dimensions-item-tracking-as-foundation-vertical-solutions,,,,
Improved extensibility of reservation management,Improved extensibility of reservation management,<p><p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Here is the list of changes and extensibility enhancements in reservation management:Entry Summary No. has been converted to enum 338 Reservation Summary Type.The Reservation Management codeunit has been reworked to use a subscriber model. A new interface based on RecordRef and RecordVariant replaces a set of procedures for each source table.Case statements for each source table have been replaced by events to subscribe in the [SourceTable]Reserve codeunits.Each [SourceTable]Reserve.Codeunit contains a set of subscribers to events in the Reservation Management codeunit in order to support reservation.Procedures that are related to reservation are added in scope of each source table to support the Reserve codeunits.As a result of the described changes you now have the following experience as a developer who extends our code:Additional supply/demand tables and pages can be added into the reservation calculation (including availability) using the standard Publisher-Subscriber model.The use of global variables and cross-linking of reservation objects methods is eliminated.Each source table contains procedures and events as a Reservation interface.Note that old methods are marked with the [Obsolete] tag but still work so that we have full compatibility with existing solutions. Make sure that you switch your code to use the new methods as soon as possible though and use the content of the obsoleted methods as an example.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/improved-extensibility-reservation-management,,,,
New AL objects â Entitlement PermissionSet and PermissionSetExtension,New AL objects â Entitlement PermissionSet and PermissionSetExtension,<p>The ability to manage user access to the functionality provided by a business application is a cornerstone of any successful solution or service. The Business Central application and service helps organizations across the world manage their most valuable and sensitive data.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Business Central uses two main concepts for defining access to the functionality:EntitlementsPermissionsEntitlements describe which objects in Business Central a customer is entitled to use according to the license that they purchased from Microsoft or the Azure Active Directory role that they have assigned in the Microsoft 365 admin center (such as Global Administrator).Permissions describe which objects an administrator or a partner gave to the customer user.In the previous releases of Business Central permissions and entitlements were defined as data in the application database. Keeping such sensitive information as data comes with additional security and audit risks. Changes applied to this data should ideally be well traceable. &quot;Treat your critical data as you treat your code&quot; is a mantra applied to this type of sensitive data in DevOps practices. With this release of Business Central we are turning this data into code.Three new object types are introduced in the AL language:EntitlementPermissionSetPermissionSetExtensionThis change will give you all of the advantages of using the AL Language extension in Visual Studio Code and source control systems (as Visual Studio Online and GitHub) to design get an overview and track changes to the objects that describe user access.Permissions and entitlements issues also fall into a category of frequently experienced issues online and on-premises. Turning this data into code has another significant advantage: the ability to apply hotfixes to the entitlements and permissions in the same way that the hotfixes are applied to the apps themselves simply by updating an app to a new version that carries fixed code. This improves Business Central online support agility considerably ultimately improving customer satisfaction with the service.Finally the new objects that we introduce in this release are envisioned to become the core building blocks in the story of monetizing the AppSource apps. It is through these new AL objects that AppSource ISVs will be able to define which capabilities of their apps should be made available to their users when the customers purchase their app licenses. With the current release we pave the way by moving the entitlements and permission sets into AL objects for Microsoft apps so that ISVs can follow the same approach for their apps when the monetization story is introduced with one of the next releases of Business Central.NoteUsage of the Entitlement objects will be limited to Microsoft apps only in this release (enforced by the AppSource technical validation). PermissionSet and PermissionSetExtension objects will be fully available for all ISVs to use. While supplying permissions in the XML format within the app files will still be supported we encourage all ISVs to gradually move their permissions from the XML format to the new AL objects.See alsoEntitlements and Permission Sets Overview (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/new-al-objects-entitlement-permissionset-permissionsetextension,,,,
Report extensibility,Report extensibility,<p>A very common scenario is to customize reports by adding more fields to the dataset and modifying the layout. Until now you would have to take full ownership of the report dataset (for example a copy) just to make small changes thereby forcing partners to maintain a full report and prohibiting multiple ISV contributions to the same report in an extensible way. With report extensibility a new report extension object can be created which adds new fields to the dataset or a new layout.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>Ability to extend an existing report by making additive changes to the report dataset and request page. Report layouts will not have an extensibility model.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Automating parts of the technical validation in the AppSource submission process,Automating parts of the technical validation in the AppSource submission process,<p>When submitting an app to AppSource the app must pass the application validation criteria.

Therefore we are continuously investing in automating this process.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>When an app is submitted to AppSource various validations are performed. To improve the time to validation we have automated the following technical validation steps and moved them to earlier in the submission validation process:Affixes must be registered for the publisher and used.The .app file must be digitally signed.The app.json file has mandatory properties that must be included.Extensions submitted must not be runtime packages.Publisher name has been validated.To reduce the risk of failing the AppSource validation process we highly recommend that you review the technical validation checklist before submitting as well as automate the AppSource validation as part of Continuous Integration/Continuous Development as outlined in that help topic.See alsoAutomating parts of the technical validation in the AppSource submission process (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/automating-parts-technical-validation-appsource-submission-process,,,,

Save report dataset to Excel from the request page,Save report dataset to Excel from the request page,<p>When you create new reports or modify existing ones a common requirement is the ability to inspect the data that is generated for a given report dataset. This is especially needed for filtering RDLC reports and optimizing dataset performance by omitting redundant data. In the past the Windows client included the About this Report feature which let you rerun a report and view the dataset. With this new feature developers and power users can now export a report dataset to Excel to investigate the resulting dataset as part of creating report layouts.Feature details<p> <br> <h1>Feature details</h1> <p>The 2021 release wave 2 includes a feature that lets you save a report dataset to an Excel file. This feature is useful for developers consultants or power users as part of developing report layouts. It's similar to the &quot;About this Report&quot; feature in the legacy Windows client but in Excel instead. It's also useful for end users so they can export report data to Excel for further processing like filtering or pivoting. You can try out this feature in the insider build artifacts that are already available for the next version (v19). To try this feature in the insider build select the Save as Microsoft Excel (data only) action on the report request page.However because of demand and usefulness we plan to include this as an opt-in feature in a minor update of 2021 release wave 1currently targeting update 18.3. In the target release the Send to menu on the request page will include the Microsoft Excel Document (data only) action. When you choose this action the report will be rendered to include data onlythat is with no layout.
