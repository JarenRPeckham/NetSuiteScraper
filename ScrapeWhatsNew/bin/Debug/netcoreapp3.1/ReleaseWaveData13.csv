BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Application,,Account schedules  Budget Name filter for columns and more templates added,Account schedules are a fast way for businesses to generate custom G/L reports. To help you get started more easily we've added even more templates. Set a filter on Budget Name and create an account schedule that reports on actual versus budgets for both a budget and a forecast (a second budget) which is often a reporting requirement for financial departments.,To help users get off to a good start when using account schedules to create custom G/L reports we've added several new templates for account schedules. The ANALYSIS REVENUE and CASHFLOW account schedules are now available in demonstration and trial (setup data only) companies. The new account schedules are mapped to the chart of accounts that can be used for product demonstrations but they can easily be adapted to any chart of accounts.  For Column Layout there's a new Budget Name field so that you can filter on a specific budget (or budgets) for that column. This way you create account schedules that report on actual versus budget figures for both a budget and a forecast (which is a second budget).

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Application,,Add non-inventory items on requisition and planning worksheets,Some businesses use requisition or planning worksheets to enter information about the items they want to order and then create orders for the items all in one go. Enabling the worksheets to handle both physical inventory items such as chairs and non-inventory items such as services gives businesses a unified procurement process.,You can process non-inventory lines in much the same way as other types of items. If you use requisition and planning worksheets as the starting point for purchase orders in your procurement process you can manually enter lines for non-inventory items on the worksheets. Then when you create your purchase orders the non-inventory items will be included. This allows you to use same procurement process for inventoriable and non-inventoriable items.

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Application,,Bank and payment reconciliations,Bank and payment reconciliations are key processes for all businesses by providing an overview of whether the cash flow is accurate and that all transactions have been accounted for. In this release wave we make it more efficient to use those features assisting the user and give more information during the process.,The Payment Reconciliation Journal has been improved with the following capabilities:  Separate number series.Posting preview.Ability to reverse the G/L register posted through the Payment Reconciliation Journal.  The Bank Reconciliation page has been enhanced with the following capabilities:  Bank ledger entries are now filtered so only ledger entries after the statement's ending date are displayed making it simpler to get an overview.The layout of the test report has been cleaned up making it simpler to read. The report will also use the statement date as a filter for the G/L account as well as the bank account so that the focus is on the period being reconciled.When applying auto-matching the user can decide to not overwrite any of the already matched entries or to overwrite all.Many-to-1 matching is now possible so many bank statement lines can be matched against one bank ledger entry. This will support scenarios such as a bank statement splitting up sales into payment methods for which you only posted one bank ledger entry.When you transfer differences to be posted in a general journal the entries will be auto-matched when you return to the bank reconciliation reducing the redundant manual step.

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Application,,Couple records between Business Central and Dataverse (and apps for Dataverse) in bulk,When you integrate Business Central with Microsoft Dataverse or Dynamics 365 Sales both systems often already contain data. Because data in Dataverse can come from multiple sources there might be data that you don't want to transfer to Business Central because it could impact financial reports and other business processes such as invoicing and tax calculations. Bulk-coupling speeds up the process of coupling multiple records while letting you define rules to control how the couplings are made.,When you couple the records that you want to synchronize data for in each applicationfor example a customer in Business Central and an account in Dataverseyou can filter and choose the data to synchronize using the new Coupled in Dataverse column. To match and couple selected records between Business Central and Dataverse or Dynamics 365 Sales you use the Match-Based Coupling action.    The Select Coupling Criteria page allows you to select the fields to match by choosing the Match on this Field column. You can also set a Matching Priority for fields and specify whether you want Business Central to create new records when a match isn't found by turning on the Create New If Unable to Find a Match toggle.    Rather than writing custom business logic in a per-tenant extension to define how to match and couple records between Business Central and Dataverse or Dynamics 365 Sales you can define the fields to match on the Integration Field Mapping page for entire mapping.    Business Central will use those settings to automatically match and couple records. Additionally this also makes it easier to migrate data from Business Central (on-premises) to Business Central online.

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Application,,Improved user experience to keep posting setup and dimension issues from going wrong,Posting groups and dimensions can be difficult concepts to understand. It's best to set up posting groups and dimensions up front. However many companies do that as they go and resolve issues as they arise. We've added tools that support learning by capitalizing on concrete examplesfor example when documents are using posting groups that are not set up correctly or have incorrect dimensions or dimension values. Accountants controllers and finance people know how specific transactions need to be posted and guidance when things go wrong with posting setups and dimensions will make it easier to resolve issues.,Product telemetry shows that posting groups and dimensions errors are typically caused by incorrect setup. We've made changes to clarify the errors and provide guidance on how to resolve them. You can now investigate issues with posting setups on the Error Messages page across the application:  The Description column shows details about the error.The Source and Source Field Name columns point to the posting setup page where the error occurred and link to a page where you can resolve the issue. This requires the user to have permissions to do so.The Support URL column provides a link to a troubleshooting guide.    Additionally for dimension issues the Error Messages page provides a link in the Context column that opens a page where you can fix the issues in the document. This also requires that the user has permissions to do so.

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Application,,Integrate Business Central and Microsoft Dataverse with more efficient synchronization of multiple records,The data exchanged between Business Central and Microsoft Dataverse is synchronized based on a schedule. Occasionally there are situations where a business requires multiple records to be created synchronized or restored manually on an ad hoc basis. This feature decreases the number of synchronization jobs that are run in such cases making synchronization of multiple records faster and users more productive.,When users select multiple records such as hundreds of customers or contacts Business Central creates a single synchronization job per batch of selected records. This greatly reduces the load on the task scheduler that runs the background jobs and makes it easier for users to stay below the limits for queue entries. This new way of synchronizing batches of selected records also considers Dataverse request limits by ensuring that the batches are processed in smaller sizes.

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Application,,Item variant code on demand forecasts,Accurate demand forecasting gives businesses valuable insight into their position in the market which helps decision makers shape their strategies for pricing business growth and market potential. The ability to include the right level of detail on item variants in demand forecasts unlocks planning capabilities and reduces lead times for companies that don't have an inflow of sales orders and manage many nearly identical items.,Item variants are a great way to keep your list of items under control especially if you have a large number of items that are almost identical and vary for example only in color. Rather than setting up each variant as a separate item you can set up one item and then specify the various colors as variants of the item. In this release you can register anticipated demand not only with respect to locations and dates but with item variants as well.  This unlocks planning capabilities for companies that don't have a steady inflow of sales orders and operate using large lists of almost identical items.

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Application,,Production BOMs and routes on stockkeeping units in planning scenarios,Many businesses use stockkeeping units (SKUs) in their inventory management processes. Because SKUs often contain important information about the items they're also valuable in production processes. You can leverage the information from SKUs by assigning them to production bills of material (BOMs) and routes. Additionally it's easy to update the BOM and route on SKUs. You can simply specify a BOM and route on an item and they will be assigned to the SKU.,We have increased the number of business processes that take into account the values in the Production BOM and Production Routing fields defined on SKUs. These include the following processes:  Capable-to-promise called from sales orders.Planning worksheet including the Calculate Net Change Plan Calculate Regenerative Plan and Get Action Messages actions.Order planning.

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Application,,Rounding for base unit of measure,You can assign a base unit of measure to items but sometimes items serve more than one purpose and are sold received or consumed in different measures in sales purchase and production processes. That means it's important to be able to handle items in alternate units of measure depending on the process and accurately convert those measures to the base unit of measure.,You can specify a rounding precision for base units of measure to guide users on what to enter for a given business process and reduce rounding issues when using alternate units of measure.  When an item serves different purposes you can set up alternate units of measure for it. The base unit of measure for the item defines how you store it and the alternate units of measure define how you handle it in purchase production or sales documents. For example you may buy the item on pallets and only use single pieces in production.  When you use alternate units of measure the value in the Qty. per Unit of Measure field helps calculate the quantity in base unit of measure which can lead to rounding issues.  For example you're receiving 1 box that contains 6 items from your supplier. When the items arrive at the warehouse you discover that 1 of the 6 items is missing. You decide not to post the receipt of 1 box but to change quantity to 5/6 pieces instead. That will be converted to a receipt of 4.99998 pieces. To receive a whole number the Quantity Rounding Precision field lets you specify a value that will for example convert the quantity to 5 pieces.

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Application,,Delegated admin can create job queue entries and request approval by a licensed user,The delegated admin role enables Microsoft partners to set up and manage certain aspects of Business Central on behalf of their customers. The role is however limited in some ways. Among these limitations is the ability to create job queue entries and set them as ready to run for customers. Job queue entries are important tools for setting up and configuring Business Central tenants. Delegated admins can create job queue entries and request approval from a licensed user.,Business Central provides the delegated admin role so that people who are not employed by the customer typically Microsoft partners can set up and configure business processes for the customers. The delegated admin role is not however a licensed user in Business Central and often is only assigned temporarily so there are some limitations to what they can do. For example delegated admins cannot set up tasks that might be run after the delegated admin relationship has been revoked such as job queue entries.  That has been problematic because job queue entries are useful tools for running setup and configuration processes in Business Central and delegated admins need to be able to create and run them in their customer's tenant. In this release delegated admins can create job queue entries and set them as ready to run. Then a licensed user from the customer can start the job queue entry to complete the process that the delegated admin created.

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Development,,Generated documentation for AL language,Reference documentation is an important part of a programming language. In this release we have increased coverage of auto-generated documentation for the AL language ensuring that this is in sync with the latest changes and additions. Specifically we are adding properties triggers method options and method attributes.,AL reference documentation is used to look up documentation of types method and properties in the programming language. For many releases this documentation has been handcrafted which can lead to inconsistencies with the actual language. To ensure that the documentation is in sync with the language entries will be auto-generated and any additional content will be added manually afterward. This ensures full coverage and that the documentation better reflects the AL language as it evolves.,2021 Wave 2,-,Oct 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Development,,Profiling AL performance with snapshot debugger,Performance is top of mind for most customers especially in the world of online business. Until now apart from selected reactive telemetry allowing monitoring of customer tenants there has not been a proactive way to measure execution performance during development nor when troubleshooting specific customer support cases with performance issues. To address this we are introducing the ability to capture execution timing as part of a snapshot and investigate this in Visual Studio Code when replaying the snapshot.,Snapshot captures now include a performance profile of the executed code that is captured in the snapshot. Using a new performance profiling editor view in the AL Visual Studio Code extension developers can then investigate the time spent on execution either using top-down or bottom-up call stack views.,2021 Wave 2,Aug 1 2021,Oct 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To enable force synchronization in online environments install and sync can now also be performed as one transactional operation per database available for PowerShell scripts on-premises.,As a prerequisite for force sync support of extensions in online environments the ability to install and sync extensions as one transaction per database has been added. This capability is also available on-premises so that you can choose to only install extensions that can also synchronize for example.

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Development,,Extend general ledger posting aggregations (Invoice Post. Buffer refactoring),Regulations in different countries and industries and customer business practices can cause a need to change the way in which general ledger entries are aggregated during posting.,The Invoice Post. Buffer table has been at the center of localizations and partner customizations when changes to G/L posting are needed or when G/L entries need to be aggregated in a different way when they're posted to the general ledger. The previous design is not extensible because the primary key in that table cannot be changed without introducing breaking change across partner solutions and localizations. There are significant differences in this table across localizations in particular for APAC BE ES IT NA and RU and this has made it difficult to extract localizations to extensions.  This refactoring makes the posting process for sales purchase and service transactions extensible and enables partners to change the way the posting algorithm aggregates G/L entriesfor example by specific document lines posting groups or the tax setup required by local legislation. Partners can replace customizations by using the interface for G/L invoice posting resolve legacy issues for the Invoice Post. Buffer table and use their own implementation of G/L invoice posting.  We have removed the dependencies from the Invoice Posting Buffer table in the Base Application and built an Invoice Posting component with an interface and an extensible enum for the implementation setup.

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Development,,Richer access control for extension source in cloud environments,Currently it's possible to control access to an extension source in the cloud through the app.json property ShowMyCode. If enabling this an extension source will be available both for debug download (PTEs) and in symbols. Because of this many partners select not to share the source thereby also prohibiting debug leading to longer times to mitigate customer issues and challenges with providing alternatives for debugging a source.,For better control of source access more granular options will be provided. At this time implementation details are still being worked on. This could be solved by replacing the existing ShowMyCode property in the app.json file and enhancing it with more detailed optionsfor example AllowDebugSource AllowDownloadSource or AllowSymbolsSource.

BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Development,,Force sync of customer-specific extensions in online environments,Whenever the table schema is changed in a destructive way in an extension it can have a downstream impact for any depending extension and potentially block updates until the breaking changes have been fully resolved. Until now the process for handling destructive changes has been to implement them and then obsolete them in due time to allow a more seamless process.There can however sometimes be a need for making breaking changes. This can occur for example in cases where there is no downstream impact of the change if dependencies are under full control (for example for per-tenant extensions) or to make changes that are forced by new clashing object identities introduced upstream.To help with these scenarios we are introducing the ability to deploy per-tenant extensions (PTEs) with force schema sync mode which will allow destructive changes to the table schema in the new extension version.,When deploying a new customer-specific (per-tenant) extension to Business Central online either through the Extension Management page or the admin center it will now be possible to force any destructive table schema changes and circumvent the usual error when such changes are detected. This will allow the removal of specific tables or fields from the database.  NoteThis operation means you will lose any data that is stored in the removed tables and fields. You will still have the option to restore the database. Thus before a force sync in a production environment this should be thoroughly tested in a matching sandbox environment container or on-premises installation.,2021 Wave 2,Oct 2021,Oct 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Development,,Performance  support for included columns in keys,With the introduction of the partial record loading feature a developer can now tailor indexes to include exactly the data needed for certain queries so that all data needed for a specific query could be loaded just with the index pages.,AL developers can now create fully covering indexes that perform well. Just use the new keyword IncludedColumns in the key definition to create indexes with included columns on the leaf nodes.  Benefits of indexes with included columns are:  Included columns do not count against the 16 fields in an index definition.An index with included columns require less I/O on the database.An index with included columns is smaller and more likely to be cached in the database cache.,2021 Wave 2,Oct 2021,Oct 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Development,,Performance  support for non-clustered column store indexes,Using a non-clustered column store index (NCCI) instead of SIFT indexes can have multiple performance benefits such as reduced locking due to maintenance of SIFT indexes (SQL indexed views) faster posting and reduced storage cost (NCCIs are highly compressed).,AL developers can now create NCCIs instead of SIFT indexes. Just use the new keyword Columnstore in the table definition.  A migration path from tables with SIFT indexes to NCCIs could be:  Add all SIFT fields to the NCCI.Remove the SIFT index.If the SIFT indexes are really needed add them again using a per-tenant extension.  Using NCCIs can give you better performance especially in situations where developers forget to add one or more SIFT indexes.,2021 Wave 2,Oct 2021,Oct 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Note that this feature adds the ability to include a URL; however not all diagnostic messages will take advantage of this from the beginning.,Having links in diagnostic messages from compilation or code analyzers will support linking to additional relevant documentation about the cause of the issue as well as options for how to resolve it.,2021 Wave 2,Dec 2021,Dec 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BC,Dynamics 365 Business Central,Governance and administration,,Automatic installation and update of dependencies when updating apps in the Business Central admin center,Simplify and streamline the process of updating apps in the Business Central admin center by allowing the service to automatically install and update app dependencies.,Business Central admin center provides administrators with an overview of the apps that are installed for each Business Central environment and can help them identify which apps have updates (newer versions) available and install the updates at a convenient time.  In some scenarios however updating an app might require updating or installing other apps that it depends on. In such cases the update of the main app will probably stop until the dependencies are updated or installed which adds steps that can slow the update process. In this release we're introducing an option that lets admins review dependencies before updating and automate any steps that are needed.

CE,Dynamics 365 Field Service,Empower frontline workers,,Collaborate throughout the work order lifecycle with embedded Microsoft Teams,Field service organizations are geographically dispersed between dispatch centers customer service centers and customer locations. However collaboration is critical to ensure an optimal outcome for customers. The work order process requires collaboration between customer service agents dispatchers asset managers account representatives and multiple frontline workers. For example dispatchers constantly communicate with frontline workers to understand whether they are running on time with their current job so they can adjust the schedule accordingly. Collaboration has traditionally been a source of pain. At best when organizations have a collaboration application people need to leave their workspace and open a separate application to communicate with their colleagues wasting valuable time that could be better spent helping customers. These conversations are not linked to the work order which means that as new stakeholders are brought in they are missing critical context about the work order.In other cases organizations do not provide a collaboration application which means people use their own private tools such as SMS and other chat applications. This exposes organizations to security risks and further disconnects conversations from the rest of the team.By embedding Microsoft Teams within the work order experience you can easily collaborate with your entire organization. And when enabled even external contacts such as customers and third-party subcontractors always keep the correct information in the work order context.,With embedded Microsoft Teams collaboration into Field Service any user involved in the work order process can collaborate using Teams functionality while seeing all the critical contextual conversations to ensure an optimal outcome.  Teams integration includes the following capabilities:  Chat with colleagues from within the work order form even if the conversation is not related to the work order saving you from switching to the Microsoft Teams app whenever you need to chat. View your existing chats or initiate a new chat.Initiate a new chat with one or many colleagues and optionally link the chat to the work order. When you initiate a new linked chat you're creating a brand new chat which means any previous conversations you had with the chat participants will not be brought into the new discussion keeping the context of the chat all about the work order.If a chat is linked to a case and the case is then converted into a work order that chat will automatically link to the work order for seamless cross-departmental collaboration.Associate conversations to the work order making it easy for your team members to see a clear picture of the status and history of the work order right in the context of their workspace. As new people engage to help complete the work order - such as a new frontline worker to help fix a problem - they can easily join the conversation and help deliver exceptional service.  This integration will allow web users to seamlessly launch the full Microsoft Teams app from the chat pane and frontline workers using the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app to collaborate through the Microsoft Teams mobile app.,2021 Wave 2,-,Jan 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can theme and brand the experience to match your own company styles giving a consistent look and feel across your own web properties.  Your customers will gain access via direct invitations which can be automatically sent to new or existing customers. As part of this update you can also invite an individual customer manually if needed. When customers are scheduling they will be offered available time slots based on real-time resource availability location and skills. This update ensures that suitable resources are automatically assigned to optimize for least travel duration. This logic is based upon the resource setup that you have already configured in Dynamics 365 Field Service. Also part of this update when customers select a service time the booking incorporates the expected travel duration and adjusts the start time of the field technician such that the technician arrives at the customer's expected time.  You can also collect important pre-service customer information as part of the scheduling request which can provide guidance to service technicians when they visit. This feature is initially supported for onsite service visits only.  In this update we have also improved the experience for administrators by adding validations and error messages while configuring an incident type for self-scheduling.

CE,Dynamics 365 Field Service,Optimize service operations,,Modular work order pricing,For many field service organizations pricing is not critical or not something they intend to derive out of their Field Service solution. The new setting makes it simpler to disable pricing in a Field Service implementation where pricing is not relevant or needed within Field Service. Disabling pricing when it isn't relevant removes unnecessary elements from the user interface and business process and allows organizations to focus their system on concepts that are more critical to their business.,For many Field Service organizations pricing is not something they intend to use within their Field Service implementation. This can be because:  These service organizations don't need to see pricing information or generate invoices perhaps because they provide services to their own internal field resources and don't need to calculate a price for an invoice.Organizations may intend to generate invoices from their downstream existing ERP systems and only need Field Service to send over the relevant data that the downstream system uses to generate a price and accurate invoice.  Field Service pricing will continue to be on by default.  To disable a Field Service administrator or system administrator can change the Calculate Price toggle in Field Service settings.  When pricing is disabled required pricing fields and logic are disabled and removed from the work order work order product and work order service records; relevant out-of-the-box views for both web and Field Service mobile app users are updated.,2021 Wave 2,-,Oct 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CE,Dynamics 365 Field Service,Optimize service operations,,Work order form simplification,Work orders are critical to field service operations as they capture the customer service required the work to be done and when the work must be done. With this wave we introduce a few simple changes to the work order form that will improve the time and effort required by back-office users and frontline workers to quickly manage the work orders current state and understand or update a work order's committed service timing.,Based on customer feedback we have identified a number of ways for Field Service to simplify the work order form for back-office staff and frontline workers in the field.  This release includes a few important work order form simplifications:  Work order completion dialog: Historically when a user set the work order to complete if the work order had bookings in an incomplete state Field Service would present the user with an error message. With this improvement we've implemented a dialog to help the user understand why they're blocked and provide them with a simple action to complete or cancel their open bookings and successfully set the work order to complete. This change will help both back-office staff and frontline workers in the field as they navigate a work order through its lifecycle.Simplifying time commitments on work order: Customers have expressed confusion with the multiple fields currently available to track work order time commitments. In this release we are hiding the Date Window Start and Date Window End fields so that time commitments for all use cases leverage the Time From and Time To Promise fields including on the Field Service agreements.  For all new implementations this updated behavior will be the default; existing customers will not be impacted by this change unless their Field Service administrators or system administrators change the Pre/Post Booking Flexibility Date Field Population setting in the Agreements tab of their Field Service settings.

CE,Dynamics 365 Field Service,Optimize service operations,,Work order ribbon simplification,Work orders are critical to field service operations as they capture the customer service required the work to be done and when the work must be done. With this wave we simplify the work order ribbon to improve usability by back-office users and frontline workers so they can more easily trigger the actions important to their daily business.,Based on customer feedback we have identified a number of simplifications for the ribbon on work orders. These changes improve the usability and comprehension of the ribbon on the work order form and work order views.  Simplified ribbon for work order: We've simplified the ribbon by removing the less frequently used commands for the work order's form and list views. This change will be on by default for all new and existing organizations. As needed a Field Service admin or system admin can bring back all commands by disabling this new functionality using the new setting in Field Service Settings &gt; Show Simplified Work Order Commands.Improved geocoding and address suggestion dialog: In this release the geocode dialog has an improved layout with a larger map making it easier to move the location marker and update the geolocation along with a simplified autocomplete address field. Any updates made in the geocode dialog will be reflected back on the contextual record such as work order account contact functional location and user record types.,2021 Wave 2,-,Oct 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CE,Dynamics 365 Field Service,Resource scheduling,,Resource work hours extensibility,Many customers choose to create custom applications to manage work hours calendars. Having a programmatic way to create and update work hours calendars will make it easier to include these capabilities in their experiences. Additionally it will also let customers and partners build integrations with applications such as Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management and maintain the same work hours for their resources across multiple different systems.,With the new resource work hours extensibility you can use APIs to:  Update a resource's work hours. For example a resource works 9 AM to 5 PM Monday through Friday; these hours can be changed to 10 AM to 4 PM with a 1-hour of break at 1 PM on only Mondays and Wednesdays.Delete a resource's work hours. For example a resource has a day off planned for next Monday but as the resource's plan change they can delete the time off.    NoteThis feature is available in Unified Interface only.

FS,Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management,Distributed hybrid topology,,Edge scale units to run distributed workloads at your facility,By enabling you to run vertical functionality workloads at your facility edge scale units increase the resilience of supply chain business processes. You can run the same workloads that you run in your vertical cloud on the vertical edge. Microsoft provides out-of-the-box workloads for scale units that target processes in warehouse and manufacturing execution.,Edge scale units represent the vertical edge in the distributed hybrid topology for supply chain management. They run on-premises on hardware located at your own facilities and thereby help to increase the resilience for critical operations in your supply chain.  Even if an edge scale unit is temporarily disconnected from the internet it will continue to run its configured workloads locally. Edge scale units also allow direct integration with other local systems without connecting through the cloud.  Scale units whether in the cloud or on the edge always run under the umbrella of your supply chain hub in the cloud and can run the same vertical workload functionality. You can therefore install any of the standard workloads for manufacturing or warehouse execution that Microsoft delivers and can also run custom workloads.    With 2021 release wave 2 organizations gain the ability to deploy edge scale units using either custom-selected hardware or recommended Azure Stack appliances located at their facility. You can choose to manage your supply chain management workloads yourself or with a partner. Options include:  Custom hardware layouts which give your organization complete control over your edge unit hardware. Your own IT department selects and maintains the hardware exactly as required by your organization. The only restriction is that your solution must fulfil the hardware requirements for on-premises deployments.Azure Stack appliance which provides an integrated hardware and software solution built by trusted hardware partners and delivered ready to use straight to your datacenter.

FS,Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management,Distributed hybrid topology,,Enhanced manufacturing execution workloads on scale units,When registering material consumption inventory records on the scale unit are updated without requiring a round trip to the hub. This ensures that inventory information for the material always stays current and available to other production orders or processes. These processes can run without interruption even if the connection between the hub and scale unit is lost.,Use the Warehouse Management mobile app to register material consumption for production and batch orders when running on a scale unit  Some manufacturers especially those within process industries must explicitly register the amount of material consumed for each batch or production order. For example a scale could be used to weigh material to determine the amount that goes into a production process. To ensure full material traceability these organizations also need to register which batch numbers are consumed by the production processes.  Workers can now use the Register material consumption flow on the Warehouse Management mobile app to register quantities of material consumed for a production or batch order and register the batch and serial numbers for those materials as needed.  When registering material consumption inventory records on the scale unit are updated without requiring a round trip to the hub. This ensures that inventory information for the material always stays current and available to other production orders or processes. This capability also ensures these processes can run without interruption even if the connection between the hub and scale unit is lost.  An open application programming interface (API) for registering material consumption is also provided. This is beneficial for organizations that want to integrate with a third-party manufacturing execution system (MES) that records the weight and tracking dimensions of consumed materials.  Start production and batch orders  Production and batch orders that have a status of Started allow material consumption and finished goods to be reported. A dedicated flow called Start on the Warehouse Management mobile app enables workers to start a production or batch order. You can set up rules that automatically consume the planned amount of material for each production order (this process is also known as pre-flushing).  It is now possible to use the Start flow on a Warehouse Management mobile app that is running against a scale unit. This capability ensures that workers can still start a production order and report material consumption and finished goods even if the connection between the hub and scale unit is lost.  An open API for registering production start is also provided. This is beneficial for organizations that want to integrate with a third-party MES that provides the start signal.

Because this feature works based on inventory transactions it can also make use of inventory arrival journals and therefore works with advanced warehouse management and the transportation management module.  Work breaks  Previously the goods-in-transit order receiving process didn't support warehouse work templates with header breaks. This feature adds that support to enable inventory transactions to be split during the goods-in-transit receiving process which provides the following benefits:  Warehouse managers can establish work break rules to split large putaway jobs into smaller ones based on item location stocking limits or other factors.Work break functionality correctly handles under- and over-deliveries and makes all appropriate adjustments to the underlying data.Workers can complete or cancel each work header independently.The system correctly handles canceled work for goods-in-transit orders including after an over-delivery transaction and after applying work breaks. The related goods-in-transit and purchase orders are also automatically updated as appropriate.    See also    Update tracking for put away (docs),2021 Wave 2,Aug 18 2021,Oct 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FS,Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management,Inventory and logistics,,Park tasks in the Warehouse Management mobile app,Increase the efficiency of warehouse workers by allowing them to stop their current task to perform another more important one and then return to the original task without losing any information.,Workers using the Warehouse Management mobile app can temporarily pause the current task. They can then start and complete another important task before safely returning where they left off with the previous work.  For example a warehouse worker performing a sales picking flow might arrive at a specified location only to find that the required item is no longer present. Previously the only option would be to abandon the current pick flow and do an item inquiry to find out if more of that item is available at some other location. As a result the worker would lose their sales pick information and run the risk that another worker might grab and restart that same picking work thus creating inefficiencies. With this feature the worker can instead park the current task and go to a secondary flow (the item inquiry flow) to find a new location that contains the item replenish the location and then continue the sales pick work. This means that no information is lost and the warehouse pick work is more efficient.,2021 Wave 2,Oct 2021,Dec 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This will make shop floor workers more effective and reduce registration errors.,These enhancements enable process manufacturers and manufacturers that need to report on batch orders and register material consumption to take advantage of the production floor execution interface.  Report on co-products and by-products  Workers can use the production floor execution interface to report progress on batch orders including reporting on co-products and by-products.  Some manufactures especially those within the process industries use batch orders to manage their production processes. Batch orders are created from formulas which can be defined to have co-product and by-product output. When reporting feedback on such batch orders the amount of output needs to be registered on the formula item as well as the co-products and by-products.  Register material consumption batch numbers and serial numbers  Workers can use the production floor execution interface to register material consumption batch numbers and serial numbers.  Some manufacturers especially those within the process industries need to explicitly register the amount of material consumed for each batch or production order. For example workers might use a scale to weigh the amount of material consumed as they work. To ensure full material traceability these organizations also need to register which batch numbers were consumed when producing each product.,2021 Wave 2,Dec 2021,Jan 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FS,Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management,Planning,,Planning Optimization support for capability-based resource allocation,Companies using Planning Optimization can optimize resource usage by deferring resource allocation until productions are scheduled. This flexible solution automates resource selection during production scheduling based on individual operation capabilities and requirements.,Planning Optimization now supports production scheduling with flexible resource allocation based on resource capabilities. A capability is the ability of an operations resource to perform a particular activity. An operations resource can have more than one capability assigned to it and a capability can be assigned to more than one resource. Capabilities can be assigned to all types of resources including tools vendors machines locations facilities and human resources. Each capability can be set to ensure the selected resource has the required capability level for a given operation. Capabilities can also include a priority which is used during scheduling to optimize the resource selection based on highest available priority.  Instead of assigning specific resources or resource groups to a route operation you can define the capabilities required for each route operation. With this setup scheduling will match the required capabilities with the capabilities of available resources to determine the resource assignment for each production job.  Capability-based resource allocation is part of the materials resource planning II (MRP II) support provided by Planning Optimization. MRP II helps planners at manufacturing companies control their production schedule control resource load and determine delivery lead times. Because Planning Optimization runs as a separate service it's able to facilitate high performance production planning without slowing down the rest of the system.  With Planning Optimization support for production scheduling manufacturers can benefit from:  Significantly improved performance and scalability with in-memory processing.Minimized system impact on other processes made possible by moving master planning to its own service.Near-real-time insights into requirement changes during office hours.  For more information about the Planning Optimization migration process including answers to frequently asked questions see Migration to Planning Optimization for master planning.

FS,Finance and Operations cross-app capabilities,Data and process integration,,Change feeds in data lakes,Data lakes are changing the way customers store and work with data. Data lakes are ideal for storing large amounts of data at a fraction of the cost of storing them in a relational database. You can bring large amounts of historical data as well as data from other systems to your data lake. Data can be transformed into summaries as well as combined with other data on-demand.When working with large data volumes and by applying changes to the data that changed only since last run you can save a lot of compute costs as well as time to process.For example you can apply changes to financial summary data every few minutes as opposed to reprocessing the entire financial summary at day's end or on a monthly basis. This way you not only save on compute costs but also enable near-real-time financial reporting.,A change feed is an immutable (never modified) transaction log of all data changes in Finance and Operations apps. Change feed data available in customers' data lakes provides a chronological log of all data changes within Finance and Operations apps.  Using the change feed customers can identify changes to data (inserts updates as well as deletes) at a transaction-level detail. They can build data pipelines that react near real-time to changes in Finance and Operations data.  A change feed once written to a data lake is never modified or deleted. Customers can use the change feed to audit data changes within Finance and Operations apps as well.

FS,Finance and Operations cross-app capabilities,Power Platform convergence,,New scenarios enabled with Power Platform convergence,Microsoft Power Platform integration removes the barriers to entry for customers to fully harness the Microsoft Power Platform stack with each of their Finance and Operations environments. Features such as dual-write become a one-click experience to set up. Add-ins are now unlocked for an environment using Microsoft Power Platform integration. Virtual entities are also made available by default in the environment. Business events and create/update/delete (CUD) events in Finance and Operations apps are also integrated with Microsoft Dataverse. Note that CUD events are only going to be available with Microsoft Power Platform integration.,Microsoft Power Platform provides a suite of capabilities for Dynamics 365 applications via the Power Platform admin center. Today Finance and Operations apps are not managed by the admin center; however over time more and more management capabilities will be migrated from Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services to the admin center. In the interim customers will be able to unlock features such as dual-write virtual entities add-ins CUD events business events via Dataverse and more via Microsoft Power Platform integration functionality in Lifecycle Services.  Set up Microsoft Power Platform integration  Using a new experience on each environment in Lifecycle Services customers can complete the initial setup of the Microsoft Power Platform environment. This will provision an environment of the same type (sandbox or production) in the Power Platform admin center. This environment in the admin center will have the same name as the one from Lifecycle Services and you will also see the Finance and Operations URL populated on the environment in the admin center. This environment will be powered by Microsoft Dataverse and will have several platform solutions preinstalled for virtual entity support dual-write orchestration and more.  Unlock dual-write application setup  Once the setup is completed in Lifecycle Services the dual-write application setup button will be enabled. From here customers who want to enable this functionality can do so from Lifecycle Services in a fast and easy manner. Customers can then choose which entity maps to sync from inside the Finance and Operations app.  Virtual entities  Virtual entities are installed in the environment with the Microsoft Power Platform integration. It will no longer be required to set up manual connections between the environments as the environments are preconnected.  Authentication and authorization  Starting with version 10.0.20 Finance and Operations users who use virtual entities will no longer be required to be manually added or managed in Dataverse. When Microsoft Power Platform integration is enabled Finance and Operations users will be automatically added to Dataverse just in time when users access virtual entities from Power Apps. This functionality can be used by enabling flight BusinessEventsCDSIntegration in Finance and Operations apps.  Finance and Operations business events in Dataverse  Starting with version 10.0.20 when Microsoft Power Platform integration is enabled business events in Finance and Operations apps will converge with business events in Dataverse. This will mean that when a business event happens in a Finance and Operations app the event will be available in Dataverse. Subscribers to Finance and Operations business events will receive the event from Dataverse. This will also enable execution of C# plug-ins in Dataverse for Finance and Operations scenarios that execute in response to business events.  Finance and Operations CUD events in Dataverse  Starting with version 10.0.20 when Microsoft Power Platform integration is enabled CUD events will be available for Finance and Operations OData-enabled data entities. It will be possible going forward to subscribe to create update and delete events on Finance and Operations OData-enabled entities. CUD events will be exposed via virtual entities in Dataverse. The CUD operation in a Finance and Operations app can happen via the Finance and Operations user interface Power Apps/Power Portal using virtual entities or from Finance and Operations OData APIs. The CUD event will consistently trigger the entity regardless. This also enables execution of C# plug-ins in Dataverse for Finance and Operations scenarios that execute in response to CUD events.  Dev tools  The Plugin Registration Tool will enable registering C# plug-ins for the CUD events and business events coming from Finance and Operations apps. With the release of a Visual Studio extension for Microsoft Power Platform developers can explore Dataverse environments and write register deploy and debug C# plug-ins directly from within Visual Studio. For developer audiences already working in Visual Studio such as Finance and Operations developers this will provide one work space (Visual Studio) to author their customizations across the Dynamics 365 apps in Dataverse and Finance and Operations apps.

For example changes to a customer address or a store channel configuration. The data export updates cause a performance impact on the environments as the core retail transaction entities aren't changed and in general retail transactions entities rarely change after their initial creation.  In Commerce versions 10.0.21 and later if a user enables change tracking in the Data Management Framework for any of the retail transaction-related entities listed the user can not select the option to enable change tracking for the entire entity or the primary table. Instead only the enable custom query option configuration is available. The custom query option will ensure that change tracking will only be triggered by changes to core retail transaction tables and not by changes to other tables that have a reference relationship to the retail transaction table.  If an organization already has change tracking enabled for any of the retail transaction entities listed above and they are configured with the Enable entire entity or Enable primary table configuration upgrading to Commerce version 10.0.21 will not immediately change the change tracking configuration for these entities.

FS,Dynamics 365 Commerce,Dynamics 365 Commerce Feature,,Delay exact price calculation for orders and quotes to improve performance,Dynamics 365 Commerce supports the creation of discounts such as mix-and-match threshold and quantity discounts (multiline discounts). These discounts are applied when more than one sales line on the sales order or sales quote combine and become eligible for the discount. Whenever a new line is added to the order the pricing engine evaluates the entire cart to determine whether any of these discounts can be applied. As the sales order gets larger adding a new line gets slower. It's common for B2B companies and some B2C companies to have large order sizes and therefore taking orders can become time consuming. This feature allows organizations to delay the price and discount calculation as a means to improving performance.,With this feature organizations can configure Commerce to delay the exact price and discount calculation for a sales order or sales quote as it's being created or edited in a call center. If the feature is enabled the pricing engine only considers the sales line that is being added or edited and ignores the other sales lines. In this case the net amount for an item includes the price calculation and simple discounts (for example discount percentage or amount off on an individual item) but the mix-and-match threshold and quantity discounts aren't applied. The user can select Recalculate Totals or Complete if they want an exact calculation while adding sales lines.,2021 Wave 2,Sep 2021,Oct 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
