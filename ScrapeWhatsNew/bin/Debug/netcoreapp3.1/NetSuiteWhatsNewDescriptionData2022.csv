Record Pages Monitor Updates,Record Pages Monitor Updates,Record Pages Monitor Updates          Application Performance Management (APM) version 2.1.0 includes the following updates to the Record Pages Monitor tool:                                    Filtering and sorting options - Prior to this release Record Pages Monitor filters the record operation tiles to show only the 10 most utilized record operations that ran in your account. You can then sort this prefiltered list according to a defined set of options.              With APM version 2.1.0 Record Operations Monitor still shows the top 10 most utilized record operations by default but it now also lets you filter according to the most used or most responsive record operations that ran in your account. As with previous releases you can also filter data according to a predefined duration or a custom date and time.              After applying the filters you may also sort the resulting tiles in alphabetical order according to their record type or operation.                                      Response time value display - Prior to this release Record Pages Monitor shows the median response times on tiles and exported CSV files. The Response Time chart displays baselines only for the 95th percentile and median values.              With APM version 2.1.0 Record Pages Monitor now shows the average response times on tiles and exported CSV files. A baseline for the average response time value is also added to the Response Time chart.

For more information see SCM Mobile.                    NetSuite 2022.1 includes the following enhancements for SCM Mobile:                                    Ability to add columns to a table - You can add columns to a Data Table element used in a standard or custom mobile process. SCM Mobile maps the rows of your additional columns with those from the columns of the existing table.              Using a RESTlet you can save the data from additional columns to a NetSuite record. For mobile configuration you can set up a RESTlet type of action for the button click event of the associated mobile page. For mobile customization you can set it up for the column click row click and button click events.                                      Enhanced navigation for popup windows - Previously you can navigate to the parent page only of a popup window. Now you can specify the target page for the mobile action that you set up to perform the navigation. You can add conditions to control the navigation.                                      Update to printer type options - When you specify a printer type you can now choose the All Types option for printers that support labels and reports. See Setting Up Your Printers.                                      Automatically Submit Default Values - This checkbox appears on the configuration and customization pages for Text Box element types. When you assign a default value to the element you can check this box. NetSuite automatically submits the default value along with the mobile page after the element is populated.              For custom mobile processes the data or page submission depends on the settings for the Action Button element that you choose as the primary action.

You can perform this process instead of adding the same information by editing a batch on the Bill Payment Batch page from the Pending Approval subtab.                                Exclude Transactions from Electronic Payments Processes            You can exclude any invoice and credit memo from electronic payments processing by checking the Exclude from Electronic Bank Payments Processing box.

Process Payments for Vendors from Primary and Secondary Banks            Starting 2022.1 you can process payments using primary or secondary entity banks. A new Entity Bank list is added on the EFT subtab for the following transaction types:                                          Bills                                            Bill Credit                                            Bill Payment                                            Commission                                            Expense Report                                      For commission transaction type the Entity Bank list is available on the Custom subtab.

All the entity banks of the transaction are shown in the Entity Bank list regardless of their bank type (primary or secondary) and subsidiaries. Selecting an entity bank at the transaction level does not depend on the EFT Bill Payment setting on the EFT Bill Payment Processing page.            The SuiteApp also includes a new EFT Global Bill Payment Processing page. On this page you can submit payment files for processing transactions with an entity bank at transaction level. The following transactions will not be processed on the EFT Global Bill Payment Processing page:                                          Transactions where an entity bank is not specified. These transactions are processed from the Bill Payment Processing page.                                            Transactions where an inactive entity bank is selected. The inactive entity bank remains selected on the transaction but the transaction will not be processed by the SuiteApp.                                                          Process Transactions for Locked Posting Period            You can post transactions or process payments in locked posting period only if the Override Period Restrictions permission is enabled for your account.

When the script runs it sets the status of the stuck PFA to failed and automatically processes the next PFA in the queue. You can run the script deployment customdeploy_15531_auto_queued_pfa_ss on demand or you can set a schedule for it to run daily.            Alternatively you can manually set the status of stuck PFAs to failed to continue processing PFAs in queue.

SuiteScript Permission for Custom EFT Role            The Custom EFT role is updated to include the SuiteScript permission with View level to enable payment reversals. If you have an existing custom role created from the Custom EFT role then you need to add this permission manually. Otherwise opening the Payment Reversals page without updating the custom role permission can lead to errors in certain scenarios.

Dataset Linking in the Workbook UI,Dataset Linking in the Workbook UI,Dataset Linking in the Workbook UI          You can now link two datasets in the Workbook UI. Linking datasets enables you to analyze metrics from two datasets in a single visualization based on a link that you define using at least one field in each dataset. You can link datasets even if they are based on record types that do not have predefined common keys in the analytics data source unlike when you join record types in a dataset. Additionally with linked datasets you can compare data that exists on two different levels of aggregation like the sum of individual transactions versus a monthly budget.                    To create a link you must define at least one set of common keys between two datasets. Common keys are fields that contain the same types of data such as the sales rep field in the sales (invoiced) and transaction record types. When you create a link recommended common keys are highlighted in blue and automatically defined based on the datasets you choose. You can also define your own common keys using fields from either dataset with some caveats.          For more information about how to create and use linked datasets see Dataset Linking in SuiteAnalytics Workbook.

Required Update of SuiteAnalytics Connect Drivers,Required Update of SuiteAnalytics Connect Drivers,Required Update of SuiteAnalytics Connect Drivers          All NetSuite accounts are being moved to new NetSuite data centers that are built on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). To ensure a smooth transition all users who use SuiteAnalytics Connect must upgrade to the latest ODBC or JDBC driver and change the connection attributes on their computers by May 12 2022. If you do not take these required actions by this date you may experience a delay of up to 30 seconds when you log out of your Connect session.          The latest ODBC driver version has been available for download since February 25 2022.                      Note:             If you use the ADO.NET driver no action is required.                    To download the latest driver version log in to NetSuite. In the Settings portlet on the Home page click Set Up SuiteAnalytics Connect. Before you install or upgrade the Connect driver ensure that you meet the installation prerequisites. For more information see Installation Prerequisites.          See the following table for more information about upgrading your drivers:                                                                                          Driver Type                                                        Required Driver Version                                                        Required Actions                                                                                                                    Windows ODBC                                                        8.10.143.0 or later                                                        Upgrade to this version is required.                    The preferred upgrade option is to download the driver and then run the installer. If you choose this option you do not need to perform any further steps unless you use a DSN-less connection.                                          Note:                       The following option is not recommended: You should uninstall the old driver and then install the new one. If you choose this option you will need to update the existing Data Source Name (DSN) values in the Windows registry. For more information see ODBC Installation on Windows for Installer Only.

On the General subtab of the Approval Preferences page (Setup &gt; Approval Process Manager &gt; Preferences) you can select which record types can be saved as a draft in the Enable Draft Status field.

To initiate the approval process you must click the Submit for Approval button.                                      These enhancements enable you to save and review the records for any changes needed.

Record Locking and Reapproval            The Approval Rule page and Approval Rule assistant now include a new section Set Up Locking and Reapproval. This section includes the following capabilities:                                          Record locking based on approval status  When creating approval rules you have the following record locking options:                                                      Lock records in Pending Approval or Approved status or both.                                                        Allow editing of records regardless of approval status.                                                  This capability applies to purchase orders vendor bills and expense reports.                                            Setting of percentage or amount tolerance limits  You can set tolerance limits to control whether records are rerouted for approval. Tolerance limits affect only pending approval and approved records.                The system reroutes records for approval using the same approval rule if the change in the record amounts exceed the set percentage or amount tolerance.
