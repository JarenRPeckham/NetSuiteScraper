You can then sort this prefiltered list according to a defined set of options.              With APM version 2.1.0 Record Operations Monitor still shows the top 10 most utilized record operations by default but it now also lets you filter according to the most used or most responsive record operations that ran in your account. As with previous releases you can also filter data according to a predefined duration or a custom date and time.              After applying the filters you may also sort the resulting tiles in alphabetical order according to their record type or operation.                                      Response time value display - Prior to this release Record Pages Monitor shows the median response times on tiles and exported CSV files. The Response Time chart displays baselines only for the 95th percentile and median values.              With APM version 2.1.0 Record Pages Monitor now shows the average response times on tiles and exported CSV files. A baseline for the average response time value is also added to the Response Time chart.

FS,Authentication,Authentication Testing,,The Signature for Web Services and RESTlets,,,Generate a Signature                      Warning:             The end of support for the HMAC-SHA1 signature method targeted for 2021.2 has been postponed. However the algorithm used by the HMAC-SHA1 signature method is no longer considered secure. You should update your integrations to use the HMAC-SHA256 signature method as soon as possible.                    Some users have difficulty constructing a valid signature.          The following sections describes how to correctly create a signature and provides PHP examples for each step.                                                    Input Parameters for the Example                                                                    Step One Construct a Base String for the Signature                                                                    Step Two Signature Key                                                                    Step Three Signature                                                          Note:             All encoding in TBA is percent encoding. For more information about percent encoding go to (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.6). The examples in this section use PHP rawurlencode.                                Input Parameters for the Example            These are the input parameters used for this example.                          $url = 'https://123456.restlets.api.netsuite.com/app/site/hosting/restlet.nl?script=6&amp;deploy=1&amp;customParam=someValue&amp;testParam=someOtherValue';//or https://123456.suitetalk.api.netsuite.com/services/NetSuitePort_2015_2 for webservices//or https://123456.suitetalk.api.netsuite.com/services/rest/record/v1/employee/40 for REST web services$httpMethod = 'POST'; //or $httpMethod = 'GET'; for REST Web Services$tokenKey = '2b0ce516420110bcbd36b69e99196d1b7f6de3c6234c5afb799b73d87569f5cc';$tokenSecret = 'c29a677df7d5439a458c063654187e3d678d73aca8e3c9d8bea1478a3eb0d295';$consumerKey = 'ef40afdd8abaac111b13825dd5e5e2ddddb44f86d5a0dd6dcf38c20aae6b67e4';$consumerSecret = 'd26ad321a4b2f23b0741c8d38392ce01c3e23e109df6c96eac6d099e9ab9e8b5';$signatureMethod = 'HMAC-SHA256';     //or HMAC-SHA1$nonce = 'fjaLirsIcCGVZWzBX0pg';      //substr(str_shuffle("0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ") 0 20);$timestamp = '1508242306';            //time();$version = '1.0';$realm = '123456';                   //scompid                                             Step One Construct a Base String for the Signature            The first step in creating signature is constructing a Base String. This is the only step in generating a signature which is different for SOAP web services and RESTlets.                          Note:               If you are constructing a signature for the TBA authorization flow be aware of the following:                                                The token and oauth_verifier parameters required for the base string are not shown in the following examples. See The Three-Step TBA Authorization Flow for information about these parameters.                                                  Except for the realm parameter all parameters shown in the table in Request Header Parameters in the Authorization Header for Step One must be part of base string.                                                  You can follow the RESTlets format as a guideline for constructing the base string as RESTlets also follows the OAuth 1.0 specification.                                                                    SOAP Web Services                              $baseString = rawurlencode($realm) ."&amp;". rawurlencode($consumerKey) ."&amp;". rawurlencode($tokenKey) ."&amp;". rawurlencode($nonce) ."&amp;". rawurlencode($timestamp);                                             SOAP Web Services Base String Example                For SOAP web services the creation of the Base String creation is straightforward. Use percent encoding.

For more information see SCM Mobile.                    NetSuite 2022.1 includes the following enhancements for SCM Mobile:                                    Ability to add columns to a table - You can add columns to a Data Table element used in a standard or custom mobile process. SCM Mobile maps the rows of your additional columns with those from the columns of the existing table.              Using a RESTlet you can save the data from additional columns to a NetSuite record. For mobile configuration you can set up a RESTlet type of action for the button click event of the associated mobile page. For mobile customization you can set it up for the column click row click and button click events.                                      Enhanced navigation for popup windows - Previously you can navigate to the parent page only of a popup window. Now you can specify the target page for the mobile action that you set up to perform the navigation. You can add conditions to control the navigation.                                      Update to printer type options - When you specify a printer type you can now choose the All Types option for printers that support labels and reports. See Setting Up Your Printers.                                      Automatically Submit Default Values - This checkbox appears on the configuration and customization pages for Text Box element types. When you assign a default value to the element you can check this box. NetSuite automatically submits the default value along with the mobile page after the element is populated.              For custom mobile processes the data or page submission depends on the settings for the Action Button element that you choose as the primary action.

FS,Inventory Management,Inventory Management Testing,,Quality Management Enhancements,,,SCM Mobile Enhancements                      Note:             SCM Mobile is shared with the following NetSuite features and SuiteApps: Warehouse Management Manufacturing Mobile and Pack Station. For more information see SCM Mobile.                    NetSuite 2022.1 includes the following enhancements for SCM Mobile:                                    Ability to add columns to a table - You can add columns to a Data Table element used in a standard or custom mobile process. SCM Mobile maps the rows of your additional columns with those from the columns of the existing table.              Using a RESTlet you can save the data from additional columns to a NetSuite record. For mobile configuration you can set up a RESTlet type of action for the button click event of the associated mobile page. For mobile customization you can set it up for the column click row click and button click events.                                      Enhanced navigation for popup windows - Previously you can navigate to the parent page only of a popup window. Now you can specify the target page for the mobile action that you set up to perform the navigation. You can add conditions to control the navigation.                                      Update to printer type options - When you specify a printer type you can now choose the All Types option for printers that support labels and reports. See Setting Up Your Printers.                                      Automatically Submit Default Values - This checkbox appears on the configuration and customization pages for Text Box element types. When you assign a default value to the element you can check this box. NetSuite automatically submits the default value along with the mobile page after the element is populated.              For custom mobile processes the data or page submission depends on the settings for the Action Button element that you choose as the primary action.

FS,Inventory Management,Inventory Management Testing,,SCM Mobile Enhancements,,,New On-demand Inspection Queue Capability in Quality Management          Starting 2022.1 you can trigger an inspection queue on demand with or without reference to a NetSuite transaction context. Quality Management SuiteApp provides enhanced quality control with ad hoc inspection queues which you can manually trigger to inspect items.          You can create the following types of ad hoc inspection queues:                                    A queue with a transaction reference â to inspect an item with reference to a parent or an inventory transaction before you receive it in inventory or after rework with different inspection criteria.                                      A queue without a transaction reference â to inspect an item on a shelf or in inventory at any time.

SCM Mobile maps the rows of your additional columns with those from the columns of the existing table.              Using a RESTlet you can save the data from additional columns to a NetSuite record. For mobile configuration you can set up a RESTlet type of action for the button click event of the associated mobile page. For mobile customization you can set it up for the column click row click and button click events.                                      Enhanced navigation for popup windows - Previously you can navigate to the parent page only of a popup window. Now you can specify the target page for the mobile action that you set up to perform the navigation. You can add conditions to control the navigation.                                      Update to printer type options - When you specify a printer type you can now choose the All Types option for printers that support labels and reports. See Setting Up Your Printers.                                      Automatically Submit Default Values - This checkbox appears on the configuration and customization pages for Text Box element types. When you assign a default value to the element you can check this box. NetSuite automatically submits the default value along with the mobile page after the element is populated.              For custom mobile processes the data or page submission depends on the settings for the Action Button element that you choose as the primary action.

FEFO lot assignments preferences - You can now set your preferences for each location with the FEFO Lot Assignment preferences. When the SuiteApp is updated to the new version:                                                The SuiteApp creates FEFO Lot Assignment preferences for each location and configures the preferences to commit and assign mode. You may later update the preferences for each location.                                                  The SuiteApp checks lots of the existing lot numbered items. If all the lots of an item have an expiration date then the SuiteApp checks the Expiry Date Required box for the item. If one or more lots do not have the expiration date set then the SuiteApp does not check the Expiry Date Required box for the item.

You can perform this process instead of adding the same information by editing a batch on the Bill Payment Batch page from the Pending Approval subtab.                                Exclude Transactions from Electronic Payments Processes            You can exclude any invoice and credit memo from electronic payments processing by checking the Exclude from Electronic Bank Payments Processing box. This box is available on invoice credit memo and sales order records.                                Process Payments for Vendors from Primary and Secondary Banks            Starting 2022.1 you can process payments using primary or secondary entity banks. A new Entity Bank list is added on the EFT subtab for the following transaction types:                                          Bills                                            Bill Credit                                            Bill Payment                                            Commission                                            Expense Report                                      For commission transaction type the Entity Bank list is available on the Custom subtab. The Entity Bank (Employee) list is used for employee commission transactions and the Entity Bank (Vendor) list is used for partner commission transactions.            All the entity banks of the transaction are shown in the Entity Bank list regardless of their bank type (primary or secondary) and subsidiaries. Selecting an entity bank at the transaction level does not depend on the EFT Bill Payment setting on the EFT Bill Payment Processing page.            The SuiteApp also includes a new EFT Global Bill Payment Processing page. On this page you can submit payment files for processing transactions with an entity bank at transaction level. The following transactions will not be processed on the EFT Global Bill Payment Processing page:                                          Transactions where an entity bank is not specified. These transactions are processed from the Bill Payment Processing page.                                            Transactions where an inactive entity bank is selected. The inactive entity bank remains selected on the transaction but the transaction will not be processed by the SuiteApp.                                                          Process Transactions for Locked Posting Period            You can post transactions or process payments in locked posting period only if the Override Period Restrictions permission is enabled for your account. If the Override Period Restrictions permission is not enabled in your account then the locked period posting is restricted for the following payment processes:                                          Bill Payments Processing or Invoice Payments Processing                                            Payment Reversals                                            Rollback and Reprocess                                            Batch Processes                                            EPAPI                                                          Auto Process Payment File Administration (PFA) Stuck in Queue            Electronic Bank Payments version 2022.1 includes a new map/reduce script Auto Process Queued PFA which lets you process PFA stuck in a payment queue. When the script runs it sets the status of the stuck PFA to failed and automatically processes the next PFA in the queue. You can run the script deployment customdeploy_15531_auto_queued_pfa_ss on demand or you can set a schedule for it to run daily.            Alternatively you can manually set the status of stuck PFAs to failed to continue processing PFAs in queue. To manually set the status of a stuck PFA see the SuiteAnswers support article Payment File Administration Stuck in Queued Status (Answer ID: 26150)(Topic available only in English).                                SuiteScript Permission for Custom EFT Role            The Custom EFT role is updated to include the SuiteScript permission with View level to enable payment reversals. If you have an existing custom role created from the Custom EFT role then you need to add this permission manually. Otherwise opening the Payment Reversals page without updating the custom role permission can lead to errors in certain scenarios.            When you create a new custom role from the Custom EFT role the SuiteScript permission is automatically added.,Electronic Bank Payment Enhancements,2022 Wave 1,,,,,,,,,,,,No

You can perform this process instead of adding the same information by editing a batch on the Bill Payment Batch page from the Pending Approval subtab.                                Exclude Transactions from Electronic Payments Processes            You can exclude any invoice and credit memo from electronic payments processing by checking the Exclude from Electronic Bank Payments Processing box. This box is available on invoice credit memo and sales order records.                                Process Payments for Vendors from Primary and Secondary Banks            Starting 2022.1 you can process payments using primary or secondary entity banks. A new Entity Bank list is added on the EFT subtab for the following transaction types:                                          Bills                                            Bill Credit                                            Bill Payment                                            Commission                                            Expense Report                                      For commission transaction type the Entity Bank list is available on the Custom subtab. The Entity Bank (Employee) list is used for employee commission transactions and the Entity Bank (Vendor) list is used for partner commission transactions.            All the entity banks of the transaction are shown in the Entity Bank list regardless of their bank type (primary or secondary) and subsidiaries. Selecting an entity bank at the transaction level does not depend on the EFT Bill Payment setting on the EFT Bill Payment Processing page.            The SuiteApp also includes a new EFT Global Bill Payment Processing page. On this page you can submit payment files for processing transactions with an entity bank at transaction level. The following transactions will not be processed on the EFT Global Bill Payment Processing page:                                          Transactions where an entity bank is not specified. These transactions are processed from the Bill Payment Processing page.                                            Transactions where an inactive entity bank is selected. The inactive entity bank remains selected on the transaction but the transaction will not be processed by the SuiteApp.                                                          Process Transactions for Locked Posting Period            You can post transactions or process payments in locked posting period only if the Override Period Restrictions permission is enabled for your account. If the Override Period Restrictions permission is not enabled in your account then the locked period posting is restricted for the following payment processes:                                          Bill Payments Processing or Invoice Payments Processing                                            Payment Reversals                                            Rollback and Reprocess                                            Batch Processes                                            EPAPI                                                          Auto Process Payment File Administration (PFA) Stuck in Queue            Electronic Bank Payments version 2022.1 includes a new map/reduce script Auto Process Queued PFA which lets you process PFA stuck in a payment queue. When the script runs it sets the status of the stuck PFA to failed and automatically processes the next PFA in the queue. You can run the script deployment customdeploy_15531_auto_queued_pfa_ss on demand or you can set a schedule for it to run daily.            Alternatively you can manually set the status of stuck PFAs to failed to continue processing PFAs in queue. To manually set the status of a stuck PFA see the SuiteAnswers support article Payment File Administration Stuck in Queued Status (Answer ID: 26150)(Topic available only in English).                                SuiteScript Permission for Custom EFT Role            The Custom EFT role is updated to include the SuiteScript permission with View level to enable payment reversals. If you have an existing custom role created from the Custom EFT role then you need to add this permission manually. Otherwise opening the Payment Reversals page without updating the custom role permission can lead to errors in certain scenarios.            When you create a new custom role from the Custom EFT role the SuiteScript permission is automatically added.,Electronic Bank Payment Enhancements,2022 Wave 1,,,,,,,,,,,,No

You can perform this process instead of adding the same information by editing a batch on the Bill Payment Batch page from the Pending Approval subtab.                                Exclude Transactions from Electronic Payments Processes            You can exclude any invoice and credit memo from electronic payments processing by checking the Exclude from Electronic Bank Payments Processing box.

Process Payments for Vendors from Primary and Secondary Banks            Starting 2022.1 you can process payments using primary or secondary entity banks. A new Entity Bank list is added on the EFT subtab for the following transaction types:                                          Bills                                            Bill Credit                                            Bill Payment                                            Commission                                            Expense Report                                      For commission transaction type the Entity Bank list is available on the Custom subtab.

All the entity banks of the transaction are shown in the Entity Bank list regardless of their bank type (primary or secondary) and subsidiaries. Selecting an entity bank at the transaction level does not depend on the EFT Bill Payment setting on the EFT Bill Payment Processing page.            The SuiteApp also includes a new EFT Global Bill Payment Processing page. On this page you can submit payment files for processing transactions with an entity bank at transaction level. The following transactions will not be processed on the EFT Global Bill Payment Processing page:                                          Transactions where an entity bank is not specified. These transactions are processed from the Bill Payment Processing page.                                            Transactions where an inactive entity bank is selected. The inactive entity bank remains selected on the transaction but the transaction will not be processed by the SuiteApp.                                                          Process Transactions for Locked Posting Period            You can post transactions or process payments in locked posting period only if the Override Period Restrictions permission is enabled for your account.

FS,SuiteAnalytics,SuiteAnalytics Testing,,Connecting Using a Connection String,,,Dataset Linking in the Workbook UI          You can now link two datasets in the Workbook UI. Linking datasets enables you to analyze metrics from two datasets in a single visualization based on a link that you define using at least one field in each dataset. You can link datasets even if they are based on record types that do not have predefined common keys in the analytics data source unlike when you join record types in a dataset. Additionally with linked datasets you can compare data that exists on two different levels of aggregation like the sum of individual transactions versus a monthly budget.                    To create a link you must define at least one set of common keys between two datasets. Common keys are fields that contain the same types of data such as the sales rep field in the sales (invoiced) and transaction record types. When you create a link recommended common keys are highlighted in blue and automatically defined based on the datasets you choose. You can also define your own common keys using fields from either dataset with some caveats.          For more information about how to create and use linked datasets see Dataset Linking in SuiteAnalytics Workbook.

FS,SuiteAnalytics,SuiteAnalytics Testing,,Connecting Using a Connection String,,,Static Data Model Now Available for NetSuite2.com Data Source          The NetSuite2.com data source applies role-based access control. This means that the features roles and permissions assigned to your account determine the data that you can access through Connect.          The new Static Data Model provides you with an overview of all available record types and fields. Using the Static Data Model SuiteAnalytics Connect still applies role-based permissions. Therefore you can only get the data for the records that you can access but you can see the structure and the name of all available record types and fields.          To use the Static Data Model in your account you must add the StaticSchema attribute to your driver configuration.

FS,SuiteAnalytics,SuiteAnalytics Testing,,Connecting Using a Connection String,,,Record Types for the Analytics Data Source          The analytics data source is regularly updated with newly exposed record types and fields. When you work with the analytics data source you can use the Records Catalog to find record type and field names.                      Note:             Currently the Records Catalog provides information about record types available to the SuiteScript Analytic API only.                    You can access the analytics data source using several tools but some newly exposed record types and fields may not be available to all of them.          To view all the available record types and fields for the tool that you use see the following topics:                                    SuiteScript Analytics API - SuiteScript Analytic API in Records Catalog                                      SuiteAnalytics Connect - 2022.1 Record Types for Connect                                      SuiteAnalytics Workbook - The Analytics Data Source and SuiteAnalytics Workbook                                      SuiteTalk REST Web Services - SuiteTalk REST Web Services Records Guide                                For more information about the Records Catalog see Records Catalog Overview.,Record Types for the Analytics Data Source,2022 Wave 1,,,,,,,,,,,,No
FS,SuiteAnalytics,SuiteAnalytics Testing,,Connecting Using a Connection String,,,Required Update of SuiteAnalytics Connect Drivers          All NetSuite accounts are being moved to new NetSuite data centers that are built on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). To ensure a smooth transition all users who use SuiteAnalytics Connect must upgrade to the latest ODBC or JDBC driver and change the connection attributes on their computers by May 12 2022. If you do not take these required actions by this date you may experience a delay of up to 30 seconds when you log out of your Connect session.          The latest ODBC driver version has been available for download since February 25 2022.                      Note:             If you use the ADO.NET driver no action is required.                    To download the latest driver version log in to NetSuite. In the Settings portlet on the Home page click Set Up SuiteAnalytics Connect. Before you install or upgrade the Connect driver ensure that you meet the installation prerequisites. For more information see Installation Prerequisites.          See the following table for more information about upgrading your drivers:                                                                                          Driver Type                                                        Required Driver Version                                                        Required Actions                                                                                                                    Windows ODBC                                                        8.10.143.0 or later                                                        Upgrade to this version is required.                    The preferred upgrade option is to download the driver and then run the installer. If you choose this option you do not need to perform any further steps unless you use a DSN-less connection.                                          Note:                       The following option is not recommended: You should uninstall the old driver and then install the new one. If you choose this option you will need to update the existing Data Source Name (DSN) values in the Windows registry. For more information see ODBC Installation on Windows for Installer Only.                                        If you use a DSN-less connection you must also update your connection string to include the following attribute: AllowSinglePacketLogout=1.                    For more information see Connecting Using a Connection String.

You must add the attribute AllowSinglePacketLogout=1 to your configuration.                    For DSN connections you must ensure that the odbc[64].ini file includes the attribute for each data source. After installing the driver do one of the following:                                                                  Edit the odbc[64].ini file to include the attribute.                                                                    Overwrite the existing INI file with the odbc[64].ini file from the downloadable ZIP file. This file contains the new attribute.                                                              For more information see Configuring the ODBC Data Source on Linux.                    For DSN-less connections you must update the connection string to include the attribute.

FS,SuiteAnalytics,SuiteAnalytics Testing,,Configuring the ODBC Data Source on Linux,,,Dataset Linking in the Workbook UI          You can now link two datasets in the Workbook UI. Linking datasets enables you to analyze metrics from two datasets in a single visualization based on a link that you define using at least one field in each dataset. You can link datasets even if they are based on record types that do not have predefined common keys in the analytics data source unlike when you join record types in a dataset. Additionally with linked datasets you can compare data that exists on two different levels of aggregation like the sum of individual transactions versus a monthly budget.                    To create a link you must define at least one set of common keys between two datasets. Common keys are fields that contain the same types of data such as the sales rep field in the sales (invoiced) and transaction record types. When you create a link recommended common keys are highlighted in blue and automatically defined based on the datasets you choose. You can also define your own common keys using fields from either dataset with some caveats.          For more information about how to create and use linked datasets see Dataset Linking in SuiteAnalytics Workbook.

FS,SuiteAnalytics,SuiteAnalytics Testing,,Configuring the ODBC Data Source on Linux,,,Required Update of SuiteAnalytics Connect Drivers          All NetSuite accounts are being moved to new NetSuite data centers that are built on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). To ensure a smooth transition all users who use SuiteAnalytics Connect must upgrade to the latest ODBC or JDBC driver and change the connection attributes on their computers by May 12 2022. If you do not take these required actions by this date you may experience a delay of up to 30 seconds when you log out of your Connect session.          The latest ODBC driver version has been available for download since February 25 2022.                      Note:             If you use the ADO.NET driver no action is required.                    To download the latest driver version log in to NetSuite. In the Settings portlet on the Home page click Set Up SuiteAnalytics Connect. Before you install or upgrade the Connect driver ensure that you meet the installation prerequisites. For more information see Installation Prerequisites.          See the following table for more information about upgrading your drivers:                                                                                          Driver Type                                                        Required Driver Version                                                        Required Actions                                                                                                                    Windows ODBC                                                        8.10.143.0 or later                                                        Upgrade to this version is required.                    The preferred upgrade option is to download the driver and then run the installer. If you choose this option you do not need to perform any further steps unless you use a DSN-less connection.                                          Note:                       The following option is not recommended: You should uninstall the old driver and then install the new one. If you choose this option you will need to update the existing Data Source Name (DSN) values in the Windows registry. For more information see ODBC Installation on Windows for Installer Only.                                        If you use a DSN-less connection you must also update your connection string to include the following attribute: AllowSinglePacketLogout=1.                    For more information see Connecting Using a Connection String.

Linking datasets enables you to analyze metrics from two datasets in a single visualization based on a link that you define using at least one field in each dataset. You can link datasets even if they are based on record types that do not have predefined common keys in the analytics data source unlike when you join record types in a dataset. Additionally with linked datasets you can compare data that exists on two different levels of aggregation like the sum of individual transactions versus a monthly budget.                    To create a link you must define at least one set of common keys between two datasets. Common keys are fields that contain the same types of data such as the sales rep field in the sales (invoiced) and transaction record types. When you create a link recommended common keys are highlighted in blue and automatically defined based on the datasets you choose. You can also define your own common keys using fields from either dataset with some caveats.

FS,SuiteAnalytics,SuiteAnalytics Testing,,Determining Your Connect Driver Version,,,Required Update of SuiteAnalytics Connect Drivers          All NetSuite accounts are being moved to new NetSuite data centers that are built on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). To ensure a smooth transition all users who use SuiteAnalytics Connect must upgrade to the latest ODBC or JDBC driver and change the connection attributes on their computers by May 12 2022. If you do not take these required actions by this date you may experience a delay of up to 30 seconds when you log out of your Connect session.          The latest ODBC driver version has been available for download since February 25 2022.                      Note:             If you use the ADO.NET driver no action is required.                    To download the latest driver version log in to NetSuite. In the Settings portlet on the Home page click Set Up SuiteAnalytics Connect. Before you install or upgrade the Connect driver ensure that you meet the installation prerequisites. For more information see Installation Prerequisites.          See the following table for more information about upgrading your drivers:                                                                                          Driver Type                                                        Required Driver Version                                                        Required Actions                                                                                                                    Windows ODBC                                                        8.10.143.0 or later                                                        Upgrade to this version is required.                    The preferred upgrade option is to download the driver and then run the installer. If you choose this option you do not need to perform any further steps unless you use a DSN-less connection.                                          Note:                       The following option is not recommended: You should uninstall the old driver and then install the new one. If you choose this option you will need to update the existing Data Source Name (DSN) values in the Windows registry. For more information see ODBC Installation on Windows for Installer Only.

To ensure a smooth transition all users who use SuiteAnalytics Connect must upgrade to the latest ODBC or JDBC driver and change the connection attributes on their computers by May 12 2022. If you do not take these required actions by this date you may experience a delay of up to 30 seconds when you log out of your Connect session.          The latest ODBC driver version has been available for download since February 25 2022.                      Note:             If you use the ADO.NET driver no action is required.                    To download the latest driver version log in to NetSuite. In the Settings portlet on the Home page click Set Up SuiteAnalytics Connect. Before you install or upgrade the Connect driver ensure that you meet the installation prerequisites. For more information see Installation Prerequisites.          See the following table for more information about upgrading your drivers:                                                                                          Driver Type                                                        Required Driver Version                                                        Required Actions                                                                                                                    Windows ODBC                                                        8.10.143.0 or later                                                        Upgrade to this version is required.                    The preferred upgrade option is to download the driver and then run the installer. If you choose this option you do not need to perform any further steps unless you use a DSN-less connection.                                          Note:                       The following option is not recommended: You should uninstall the old driver and then install the new one. If you choose this option you will need to update the existing Data Source Name (DSN) values in the Windows registry. For more information see ODBC Installation on Windows for Installer Only.                                        If you use a DSN-less connection you must also update your connection string to include the following attribute: AllowSinglePacketLogout=1.                    For more information see Connecting Using a Connection String.

You must add the attribute AllowSinglePacketLogout=1 to your configuration.                    For DSN connections you must ensure that the odbc[64].ini file includes the attribute for each data source. After installing the driver do one of the following:                                                                  Edit the odbc[64].ini file to include the attribute.                                                                    Overwrite the existing INI file with the odbc[64].ini file from the downloadable ZIP file. This file contains the new attribute.                                                              For more information see Configuring the ODBC Data Source on Linux.                    For DSN-less connections you must update the connection string to include the attribute.

FS,SuiteTalk Web Services Integration,SuiteTalk Web Services Integration Testing,,Assembly Item,,,Asynchronous Request Execution Is Generally Available          Besides synchronous execution you can also execute requests asynchronously in REST web services. Asynchronous request execution is now generally available.          The asynchronous execution of requests is useful for long-running requests. With asynchronous requests when you send a request to REST web services it is placed in a processing queue and handled asynchronously with other requests. Asynchronous execution involves an idempotent retry mechanism which enables you to use unique keys for asynchronous request. Using unique keys helps you to avoid duplicate requests.

FS,SuiteTalk Web Services Integration,SuiteTalk Web Services Integration Testing,,Vendor Bill,,,Asynchronous Request Execution Is Generally Available          Besides synchronous execution you can also execute requests asynchronously in REST web services. Asynchronous request execution is now generally available.          The asynchronous execution of requests is useful for long-running requests. With asynchronous requests when you send a request to REST web services it is placed in a processing queue and handled asynchronously with other requests. Asynchronous execution involves an idempotent retry mechanism which enables you to use unique keys for asynchronous request. Using unique keys helps you to avoid duplicate requests.

The PTR is a legislative requirement for large businesses in Australia that have trade credit arrangements with small businesses. It reports the payment terms and practices of your small business suppliers.            You must submit the PTR within three months after the reporting period. The Payment Times Reporting Portal requires the following:                                          CSV file containing the payment information                                            Word or PDF file containing signatures and associated declarations                                      On the Country Tax Reports page in NetSuite you can generate the PTR and then export the CSV file and the Word (.doc) file. PDF is not yet supported.            The Australian government requires you to submit the Payment Times Report in Australian dollars (AUD). If your subsidiary in Australia uses a currency that is not AUD you must set up your account to convert your transaction currency to AUD.            For more information about what you need to do before generating a PTR see Payment Times Report (PTR).

The PTR is a legislative requirement for large businesses in Australia that have trade credit arrangements with small businesses. It reports the payment terms and practices of your small business suppliers.            You must submit the PTR within three months after the reporting period. The Payment Times Reporting Portal requires the following:                                          CSV file containing the payment information                                            Word or PDF file containing signatures and associated declarations                                      On the Country Tax Reports page in NetSuite you can generate the PTR and then export the CSV file and the Word (.doc) file. PDF is not yet supported.            The Australian government requires you to submit the Payment Times Report in Australian dollars (AUD). If your subsidiary in Australia uses a currency that is not AUD you must set up your account to convert your transaction currency to AUD.

You can perform this process instead of adding the same information by editing a batch on the Bill Payment Batch page from the Pending Approval subtab.                                Exclude Transactions from Electronic Payments Processes            You can exclude any invoice and credit memo from electronic payments processing by checking the Exclude from Electronic Bank Payments Processing box. This box is available on invoice credit memo and sales order records.                                Process Payments for Vendors from Primary and Secondary Banks            Starting 2022.1 you can process payments using primary or secondary entity banks. A new Entity Bank list is added on the EFT subtab for the following transaction types:                                          Bills                                            Bill Credit                                            Bill Payment                                            Commission                                            Expense Report                                      For commission transaction type the Entity Bank list is available on the Custom subtab. The Entity Bank (Employee) list is used for employee commission transactions and the Entity Bank (Vendor) list is used for partner commission transactions.            All the entity banks of the transaction are shown in the Entity Bank list regardless of their bank type (primary or secondary) and subsidiaries. Selecting an entity bank at the transaction level does not depend on the EFT Bill Payment setting on the EFT Bill Payment Processing page.            The SuiteApp also includes a new EFT Global Bill Payment Processing page. On this page you can submit payment files for processing transactions with an entity bank at transaction level. The following transactions will not be processed on the EFT Global Bill Payment Processing page:                                          Transactions where an entity bank is not specified. These transactions are processed from the Bill Payment Processing page.                                            Transactions where an inactive entity bank is selected. The inactive entity bank remains selected on the transaction but the transaction will not be processed by the SuiteApp.                                                          Process Transactions for Locked Posting Period            You can post transactions or process payments in locked posting period only if the Override Period Restrictions permission is enabled for your account. If the Override Period Restrictions permission is not enabled in your account then the locked period posting is restricted for the following payment processes:                                          Bill Payments Processing or Invoice Payments Processing                                            Payment Reversals                                            Rollback and Reprocess                                            Batch Processes                                            EPAPI                                                          Auto Process Payment File Administration (PFA) Stuck in Queue            Electronic Bank Payments version 2022.1 includes a new map/reduce script Auto Process Queued PFA which lets you process PFA stuck in a payment queue. When the script runs it sets the status of the stuck PFA to failed and automatically processes the next PFA in the queue. You can run the script deployment customdeploy_15531_auto_queued_pfa_ss on demand or you can set a schedule for it to run daily.            Alternatively you can manually set the status of stuck PFAs to failed to continue processing PFAs in queue. To manually set the status of a stuck PFA see the SuiteAnswers support article Payment File Administration Stuck in Queued Status (Answer ID: 26150)(Topic available only in English).                                SuiteScript Permission for Custom EFT Role            The Custom EFT role is updated to include the SuiteScript permission with View level to enable payment reversals. If you have an existing custom role created from the Custom EFT role then you need to add this permission manually. Otherwise opening the Payment Reversals page without updating the custom role permission can lead to errors in certain scenarios.            When you create a new custom role from the Custom EFT role the SuiteScript permission is automatically added.,Electronic Bank Payment Enhancements,2022 Wave 1,,,,,,,,,,,,No
