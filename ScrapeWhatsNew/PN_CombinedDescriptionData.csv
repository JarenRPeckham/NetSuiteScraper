Annual Penetration testing,Annual Penetration testing,"The objective of penetration testing is to assess the current security controls in an effort to determine the actionable impact form an attacker attempting to bypass perimeter security controls and accessing the internal network or sensitive data.  The focus of penetration testing is not to prove the network is free of all vulnerabilities, but rather to validate the organization's security posture and configuration standards through assessing the resiliency of the external network against a determined attacker. Systems that could be commonly in scope for engagements include application servers, network devices, cloud infrastructure and mail servers.  Any critical findings discovered during the penetration testing will be immediately reported informally to your organization's technical staff and point of contact.  RSM's penetration testing aligns to the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) and follows the approach that includes foot printing, service and port identification, targeted social engineering, vulnerability identification and exploitation, limited vulnerability scanning, and optional data exfiltration. Internal penetration testing includes the same approach however, it will test the following networks including network infrastructure (including routers, switches and wireless access points), security infrastructure (including firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems), domain controls, database servers and web servers.

Security Architecture Review ,Security Architecture Review ,"During an Architecture Security Review, RSM assesses client's infrastructure design from a security controls perspective. This involves a review of a control set derived from the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Top 20 Critical Security Controls. RSM groups the assessed controls into the five NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF) domains:
 Identify - Controls that enable the identification of newly added assets.
 Protect - Controls that focus on edge protection as well as protection of data and assets.
 Detect - Review of log collection, event correlation, and current alerting capabilities. 
 Respond - Once an incident is detected, how quickly is the organization able to coordinate its response, how effective is the response, what's the follow through after response has been initiated. 
 Recover - The ability of the organization to recover from a confirmed incident. 
The CIS Critical Security Controls address the fundamental actions that enterprises should take to mitigate cyber risks. They focus on the ability to prevent, alert, and respond to attacks that occur in the real world. The controls have been developed by an international community of information security experts, leveraging actual attack information and effective defenses against actual cyber-attacks. The controls have been tailored to provide the most actionable measures available to detect, prevent, respond, and mitigate damage from both common and most advanced attacks.
By conducting an Architecture Security Review, client will have holistic view of how effective their current policy and programs are, what gaps are currently present, and what level of risk is currently assumed by the organization. The Architecture Security Review is a strategic initiative designed to identify gaps within current security programs and develops the roadmap to elevating the current security posture.

In most cases, an expensive IT security resource is forced to perform both the security analysis and project management components, wasting valuable time that could be spent on more pertinent projects. RSM solves this problem by engaging project management experts and security analysts, each performing the task for which they have been trained.

Cyber Governance Review,Cyber Governance Review,"As organizations continue to evolve to meet the needs of their customers, so too have regulations, security requirements and business requirements in order to protect their customers' data. This evolution increases the need for organizations to develop a consistent, repeatable and measurable program that seeks to protect data based on the risk that it presents to the organization in all locations where it is stored, processed, transmitted or accessed and the systems which are critical to the organization. RSM US LLP (RSM) has developed an approach that will allow the client to develop and deploy a program to identify, classify and protect data using a single, risk-based controls framework across the enterprise and third parties. This will create a single framework that allows for easier articulation of the security program to executives at the client.                To identify scope we would need to perform a scoping session to identify the number of business processes in scope, 2-4 hours.

End Point Protection Assessment,End Point Protection Assessment,"An end-point attack and penetration test simulates an attacker attempting to circumvent the current end-point solution and tests the overall effectiveness of the application. RSM takes a unique approach by using custom-created malicious software ranging from a variety of different experience levels to determine whether a nonsophisticated attacker or a highly sophisticated attacker would be required to bypass the end-point solution. RSM will test the end-point solution and the current configurations. RSM will offer assistance if a different solution is needed, or if configuration changes within the overall hardening of the system and/or software solution are necessary.

To identify scope we would need total number of internal and external IP's to test and a scoping call to validate.

Physical Program Assessment,Physical Program Assessment,"Physical site assessment
This assessment is a holistic look into the overall physical security of buildings, facilities and locations. We will evaluate all of the physical security controls in place at in-scope locations. For example, our staff will evaluate access control systems, security guards, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, access badges, locks, security lighting, fences, etc. The physical security assessment is a noninvasive walk-through that is guided by Wabash's security personnel while on-site. 
Physical threat assessment
A physical threat assessment allows a business to identify what physical threats there are to facilities within a geographic area. Threats to physical locations are classified as natural, technological and human caused. The combination of threat data and business processes mapping establishes threat levels for each of the scoped locations. We will categorize the facilities, analyze the threats to determine Wabash's threat level, and make recommendations on specific controls that should be put into place at each site.
A one hour scoping call is necessary to determine the number of locations, types, and needs of the client.

Security Monitoring Assessment,Security Monitoring Assessment,"The logging and monitoring assessment is designed to assist organizations in developing and tailoring an effective logging and monitoring framework for your remote workforce. Reliable logging ensures that events are recorded accurately, which can assist with forensic investigations and troubleshooting. Efficient monitoring helps organizations quickly detect and identify suspicious activity so that the proper response actions can be taken. Together, this provides the foundation for effective response and threat mitigation. It also greatly facilitates a strong defensive posture that enables the organization to meet security expectations and compliance requirements. 
We will interview your network staff and review provided documentation to determine your current logging processes. This includes reviews of on-premises, cloud, and remote architecture, appliances, operating systems, and applications. The logging and alerting assessment serves the following purposes:
 This assessment will provide an independent verification that ensures the current infrastructure and applications meet the organization's security expectations and compliance requirements. 
 This assessment will reduce the risk of data loss or network compromise by identifying and resolving vulnerabilities and weaknesses. 
We will focus on logging related to a primarily remote workforce, which will include endpoint logging strategy, correlation and alerts based on your staffing levels.
Collecting and storing logs is only one part of a log management program. Logs are useful only if they are being reviewed and acted upon. Therefore, our review covers detection mechanisms as just one element in a holistic logging program. Other areas covered include: 
Asset management Assets are known and security baselines have been established.
Detection mechanisms Controls enable the quick identification of newly added assets, as well as systems stepping outside an established baseline.
Resources Personnel are on hand to monitor detection mechanisms.

We will also review detection and response capabilities by using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework to develop and test high-risk attack scenarios.

Cybersecurity Risk Assessment,Cybersecurity Risk Assessment,"During a cybersecurity risk assessment, we will provide a quantitative assessment of information security risks in a form that can be used by executives for efficient decision-making. In addition, the results can be used to begin aligning security efforts with those within enterprise risk management. We will use the National Insititue of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to conduct this assessment, which consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity-related risks, threats and vulnerabilities present in the environment. This framework provides a prioritized and flexible approach to promote the protection of the organization's systems, infrastructure and operations. The assessment will measure COMPANYNAME's environment based on the ability to identify, protect, detect, respond to and recover from a cyber event, which are the key functions of the NIST CSF.

Organizational Threat Modeling,Organizational Threat Modeling,"To ensure a holistic cybersecurity approach, we also conduct a cyber threat intelligence (CTI) review to identify leaked client data on open and closed (deep and dark web) sources. 
""Deep web"" and ""dark web"" refer to areas of the internet that are not accessible through conventional search engines and are most well-known for hosting underground cyber markets. Illegal activity within these venues includes the sale of personal information, solicitation for stolen corporate data, such as intellectual property and user credentials, and illicit financial services allowing attackers to capitalize on their efforts. Nation states, cyber criminal gangs and malicious individuals thrive in these difficult-to-monitor areas of the web.
A CTI review allows organizations to understand cyberattacks from an adversarial perspective as they scour the underground markets and communication channels in order to identify an attack before it occurs. Often, they are the only method that organizations have to identify that an attack has been successful and is actively removing data. The purpose of a CTI review is to provide predictive, analytical, information-based services pulling from open and closed sources in order to evaluate pending threats or discover attacks that have occurred, but were not detected at the time.
