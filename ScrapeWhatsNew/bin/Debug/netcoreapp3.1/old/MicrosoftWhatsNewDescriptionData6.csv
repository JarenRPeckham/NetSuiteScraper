Collaborate throughout the work order lifecycle with embedded Microsoft Teams,Collaborate throughout the work order lifecycle with embedded Microsoft Teams,null,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/service/dynamics365-field-service/collaborate-throughout-work-order-lifecycle-embedded-teams,,,-,Jan 2022,Field service organizations are geographically dispersed between dispatch centers customer service centers and customer locations. However collaboration is critical to ensure an optimal outcome for customers. The work order process requires collaboration between customer service agents dispatchers asset managers account representatives and multiple frontline workers. For example dispatchers constantly communicate with frontline workers to understand whether they are running on time with their current job so they can adjust the schedule accordingly. Collaboration has traditionally been a source of pain. At best when organizations have a collaboration application people need to leave their workspace and open a separate application to communicate with their colleagues wasting valuable time that could be better spent helping customers. These conversations are not linked to the work order which means that as new stakeholders are brought in they are missing critical context about the work order.In other cases organizations do not provide a collaboration application which means people use their own private tools such as SMS and other chat applications. This exposes organizations to security risks and further disconnects conversations from the rest of the team.By embedding Microsoft Teams within the work order experience you can easily collaborate with your entire organization. And when enabled even external contacts such as customers and third-party subcontractors always keep the correct information in the work order context.Feature details,With embedded Microsoft Teams collaboration into Field Service any user involved in the work order process can collaborate using Teams functionality while seeing all the critical contextual conversations to ensure an optimal outcome.Teams integration includes the following capabilities:Chat with colleagues from within the work order form even if the conversation is not related to the work order saving you from switching to the Microsoft Teams app whenever you need to chat. View your existing chats or initiate a new chat.Initiate a new chat with one or many colleagues and optionally link the chat to the work order. When you initiate a new linked chat you're creating a brand new chat which means any previous conversations you had with the chat participants will not be brought into the new discussion keeping the context of the chat all about the work order.If a chat is linked to a case and the case is then converted into a work order that chat will automatically link to the work order for seamless cross-departmental collaboration.Associate conversations to the work order making it easy for your team members to see a clear picture of the status and history of the work order right in the context of their workspace. As new people engage to help complete the work order - such as a new frontline worker to help fix a problem - they can easily join the conversation and help deliver exceptional service.This integration will allow web users to seamlessly launch the full Microsoft Teams app from the chat pane and frontline workers using the Field Service (Dynamics 365) mobile app to collaborate through the Microsoft Teams mobile app.

By adopting the customer self-scheduling feature you'll empower your customers to schedule service visits at their convenience directly from their devices. This will improve their experience by providing them with flexibility reducing scheduling errors and unwanted rescheduling. It will also reduce your organization's back-office costs by reducing support call volume associated with scheduling and freeing up those resources to focus on other value-driving activities.Feature details,This is an update to the preview of the feature that was released in 2021 wave 1.With self-scheduling you empower your customers to schedule service visits based on their preferences without having to speak with a customer service agent.The self-scheduling feature is based on the Power Apps portals providing a responsive customer-focused interface that can be accessed from any device. The feature follows a similar template-based deployment pattern to that of the track my technician feature previously released in 2021 wave 1. Your customers can access self-scheduling from the customer experiences home page. You can theme and brand the experience to match your own company styles giving a consistent look and feel across your own web properties.Your customers will gain access via direct invitations which can be automatically sent to new or existing customers. As part of this update you can also invite an individual customer manually if needed. When customers are scheduling they will be offered available time slots based on real-time resource availability location and skills. This update ensures that suitable resources are automatically assigned to optimize for least travel duration. This logic is based upon the resource setup that you have already configured in Dynamics 365 Field Service. Also part of this update when customers select a service time the booking incorporates the expected travel duration and adjusts the start time of the field technician such that the technician arrives at the customer's expected time.You can also collect important pre-service customer information as part of the scheduling request which can provide guidance to service technicians when they visit. This feature is initially supported for onsite service visits only.In this update we have also improved the experience for administrators by adding validations and error messages while configuring an incident type for self-scheduling.See alsoEnable customers to self-schedule service appointments in Field Service (docs)

Modular work order pricing,Modular work order pricing,null,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/service/dynamics365-field-service/modular-work-order-pricing,,,-,Oct 2021,For many field service organizations pricing is not critical or not something they intend to derive out of their Field Service solution. The new setting makes it simpler to disable pricing in a Field Service implementation where pricing is not relevant or needed within Field Service. Disabling pricing when it isn't relevant removes unnecessary elements from the user interface and business process and allows organizations to focus their system on concepts that are more critical to their business.Feature details,For many Field Service organizations pricing is not something they intend to use within their Field Service implementation. This can be because:These service organizations don't need to see pricing information or generate invoices perhaps because they provide services to their own internal field resources and don't need to calculate a price for an invoice.Organizations may intend to generate invoices from their downstream existing ERP systems and only need Field Service to send over the relevant data that the downstream system uses to generate a price and accurate invoice.Field Service pricing will continue to be on by default.To disable a Field Service administrator or system administrator can change the Calculate Price toggle in Field Service settings.When pricing is disabled required pricing fields and logic are disabled and removed from the work order work order product and work order service records; relevant out-of-the-box views for both web and Field Service mobile app users are updated.
Work order form simplification,Work order form simplification,null,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/service/dynamics365-field-service/work-order-form-simplification,,,-,Oct 2021,Work orders are critical to field service operations as they capture the customer service required the work to be done and when the work must be done. With this wave we introduce a few simple changes to the work order form that will improve the time and effort required by back-office users and frontline workers to quickly manage the work orders current state and understand or update a work order's committed service timing.Feature details,Based on customer feedback we have identified a number of ways for Field Service to simplify the work order form for back-office staff and frontline workers in the field.This release includes a few important work order form simplifications:Work order completion dialog: Historically when a user set the work order to complete if the work order had bookings in an incomplete state Field Service would present the user with an error message. With this improvement we've implemented a dialog to help the user understand why they're blocked and provide them with a simple action to complete or cancel their open bookings and successfully set the work order to complete. This change will help both back-office staff and frontline workers in the field as they navigate a work order through its lifecycle.Simplifying time commitments on work order: Customers have expressed confusion with the multiple fields currently available to track work order time commitments. In this release we are hiding the Date Window Start and Date Window End fields so that time commitments for all use cases leverage the Time From and Time To Promise fields including on the Field Service agreements.For all new implementations this updated behavior will be the default; existing customers will not be impacted by this change unless their Field Service administrators or system administrators change the Pre/Post Booking Flexibility Date Field Population setting in the Agreements tab of their Field Service settings.See alsoWork order user interface settings (docs)
Work order ribbon simplification,Work order ribbon simplification,null,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/service/dynamics365-field-service/work-order-ribbon-simplification,,,-,Oct 2021,Work orders are critical to field service operations as they capture the customer service required the work to be done and when the work must be done. With this wave we simplify the work order ribbon to improve usability by back-office users and frontline workers so they can more easily trigger the actions important to their daily business.Feature details,Based on customer feedback we have identified a number of simplifications for the ribbon on work orders. These changes improve the usability and comprehension of the ribbon on the work order form and work order views.Simplified ribbon for work order: We've simplified the ribbon by removing the less frequently used commands for the work order's form and list views. This change will be on by default for all new and existing organizations. As needed a Field Service admin or system admin can bring back all commands by disabling this new functionality using the new setting in Field Service Settings &gt; Show Simplified Work Order Commands.Improved geocoding and address suggestion dialog: In this release the geocode dialog has an improved layout with a larger map making it easier to move the location marker and update the geolocation along with a simplified autocomplete address field. Any updates made in the geocode dialog will be reflected back on the contextual record such as work order account contact functional location and user record types.

Having a programmatic way to create and update work hours calendars will make it easier to include these capabilities in their experiences. Additionally it will also let customers and partners build integrations with applications such as Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management and maintain the same work hours for their resources across multiple different systems.Feature details,With the new resource work hours extensibility you can use APIs to:Update a resource's work hours. For example a resource works 9 AM to 5 PM Monday through Friday; these hours can be changed to 10 AM to 4 PM with a 1-hour of break at 1 PM on only Mondays and Wednesdays.Delete a resource's work hours. For example a resource has a day off planned for next Monday but as the resource's plan change they can delete the time off.NoteThis feature is available in Unified Interface only.Thank you for your ideaThank you for submitting this idea.

You can run the same workloads that you run in your vertical cloud on the vertical edge. Microsoft provides out-of-the-box workloads for scale units that target processes in warehouse and manufacturing execution.Feature details,Edge scale units represent the vertical edge in the distributed hybrid topology for supply chain management. They run on-premises on hardware located at your own facilities and thereby help to increase the resilience for critical operations in your supply chain.  Even if an edge scale unit is temporarily disconnected from the internet it will continue to run its configured workloads locally. Edge scale units also allow direct integration with other local systems without connecting through the cloud.Scale units whether in the cloud or on the edge always run under the umbrella of your supply chain hub in the cloud and can run the same vertical workload functionality. You can therefore install any of the standard workloads for manufacturing or warehouse execution that Microsoft delivers and can also run custom workloads.With 2021 release wave 2 organizations gain the ability to deploy edge scale units using either custom-selected hardware or recommended Azure Stack appliances located at their facility. You can choose to manage your supply chain management workloads yourself or with a partner. Options include:Custom hardware layouts which give your organization complete control over your edge unit hardware. Your own IT department selects and maintains the hardware exactly as required by your organization. The only restriction is that your solution must fulfil the hardware requirements for on-premises deployments.Azure Stack appliance which provides an integrated hardware and software solution built by trusted hardware partners and delivered ready to use straight to your datacenter.See alsoDeploy edge scale units on custom hardware using LBD (docs)

This ensures that inventory information for the material always stays current and available to other production orders or processes. These processes can run without interruption even if the connection between the hub and scale unit is lost.Feature details,Use the Warehouse Management mobile app to register material consumption for production and batch orders when running on a scale unitSome manufacturers especially those within process industries must explicitly register the amount of material consumed for each batch or production order. For example a scale could be used to weigh material to determine the amount that goes into a production process. To ensure full material traceability these organizations also need to register which batch numbers are consumed by the production processes.Workers can now use the Register material consumption flow on the Warehouse Management mobile app to register quantities of material consumed for a production or batch order and register the batch and serial numbers for those materials as needed.When registering material consumption inventory records on the scale unit are updated without requiring a round trip to the hub. This ensures that inventory information for the material always stays current and available to other production orders or processes. This capability also ensures these processes can run without interruption even if the connection between the hub and scale unit is lost.An open application programming interface (API) for registering material consumption is also provided. This is beneficial for organizations that want to integrate with a third-party manufacturing execution system (MES) that records the weight and tracking dimensions of consumed materials.Start production and batch ordersProduction and batch orders that have a status of Started allow material consumption and finished goods to be reported. A dedicated flow called Start on the Warehouse Management mobile app enables workers to start a production or batch order. You can set up rules that automatically consume the planned amount of material for each production order (this process is also known as pre-flushing).It is now possible to use the Start flow on a Warehouse Management mobile app that is running against a scale unit. This capability ensures that workers can still start a production order and report material consumption and finished goods even if the connection between the hub and scale unit is lost.An open API for registering production start is also provided. This is beneficial for organizations that want to integrate with a third-party MES that provides the start signal.For more information about the benefits of using scale units see Cloud and edge scale units for manufacturing and warehouse management workloads.

This improves accuracy and reduces the need for manual data entry. It furthermore enhances goods-in-transit orders to enable warehouse managers to better manage warehouse work by leveraging functionality already available for purchase orders.Feature details,This feature enhances the Landed cost module for Supply Chain Management by adding two important new capabilities: tracking updates and work breaks. The tracking update feature enables the system to automatically update the date of arrival of imported goods based on existing records of warehouse putaway work. The work breaks feature enables businesses to gain more detailed control over putaway work for goods-in-transit orders by leveraging familiar functionality already available for purchase orders.Tracking updatesThis feature enables the Landed cost module to accurately record the date of arrival for imported goods. It works by automatically updating the actual completion date for each relevant activity tracking record to match the date at which the related goods are put away at your warehouse. The feature helps to ensure accurate arrival records without relying on manual data entry.Because this feature works based on inventory transactions it can also make use of inventory arrival journals and therefore works with advanced warehouse management and the transportation management module.Work breaksPreviously the goods-in-transit order receiving process didn't support warehouse work templates with header breaks. This feature adds that support to enable inventory transactions to be split during the goods-in-transit receiving process which provides the following benefits:Warehouse managers can establish work break rules to split large putaway jobs into smaller ones based on item location stocking limits or other factors.Work break functionality correctly handles under- and over-deliveries and makes all appropriate adjustments to the underlying data.Workers can complete or cancel each work header independently.The system correctly handles canceled work for goods-in-transit orders including after an over-delivery transaction and after applying work breaks. The related goods-in-transit and purchase orders are also automatically updated as appropriate.See alsoUpdate tracking for put away (docs)
Park tasks in the Warehouse Management mobile app,Park tasks in the Warehouse Management mobile app,null,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/park-tasks-warehouse-management-mobile-app,,,Oct 2021,Dec 2021,Increase the efficiency of warehouse workers by allowing them to stop their current task to perform another more important one and then return to the original task without losing any information.Feature details,Workers using the Warehouse Management mobile app can temporarily pause the current task. They can then start and complete another important task before safely returning where they left off with the previous work.For example a warehouse worker performing a sales picking flow might arrive at a specified location only to find that the required item is no longer present. Previously the only option would be to abandon the current pick flow and do an item inquiry to find out if more of that item is available at some other location. As a result the worker would lose their sales pick information and run the risk that another worker might grab and restart that same picking work thus creating inefficiencies. With this feature the worker can instead park the current task and go to a secondary flow (the item inquiry flow) to find a new location that contains the item replenish the location and then continue the sales pick work. This means that no information is lost and the warehouse pick work is more efficient.

This flexible solution automates resource selection during production scheduling based on individual operation capabilities and requirements.Feature details,Planning Optimization now supports production scheduling with flexible resource allocation based on resource capabilities. A capability is the ability of an operations resource to perform a particular activity. An operations resource can have more than one capability assigned to it and a capability can be assigned to more than one resource. Capabilities can be assigned to all types of resources including tools vendors machines locations facilities and human resources. Each capability can be set to ensure the selected resource has the required capability level for a given operation. Capabilities can also include a priority which is used during scheduling to optimize the resource selection based on highest available priority.Instead of assigning specific resources or resource groups to a route operation you can define the capabilities required for each route operation. With this setup scheduling will match the required capabilities with the capabilities of available resources to determine the resource assignment for each production job.Capability-based resource allocation is part of the materials resource planning II (MRP II) support provided by Planning Optimization. MRP II helps planners at manufacturing companies control their production schedule control resource load and determine delivery lead times. Because Planning Optimization runs as a separate service it's able to facilitate high performance production planning without slowing down the rest of the system.With Planning Optimization support for production scheduling manufacturers can benefit from:Significantly improved performance and scalability with in-memory processing.Minimized system impact on other processes made possible by moving master planning to its own service.Near-real-time insights into requirement changes during office hours.For more information about the Planning Optimization migration process including answers to frequently asked questions see Migration to Planning Optimization for master planning.Geographic areasThis feature will be released into the following Microsoft Azure geographic areas:United StatesEuropeUnited KingdomAustraliaCanada

Data lakes are ideal for storing large amounts of data at a fraction of the cost of storing them in a relational database. You can bring large amounts of historical data as well as data from other systems to your data lake. Data can be transformed into summaries as well as combined with other data on-demand.When working with large data volumes and by applying changes to the data that changed only since last run you can save a lot of compute costs as well as time to process.For example you can apply changes to financial summary data every few minutes as opposed to reprocessing the entire financial summary at day's end or on a monthly basis. This way you not only save on compute costs but also enable near-real-time financial reporting.Feature details,A change feed is an immutable (never modified) transaction log of all data changes in Finance and Operations apps. Change feed data available in customers' data lakes provides a chronological log of all data changes within Finance and Operations apps.Using the change feed customers can identify changes to data (inserts updates as well as deletes) at a transaction-level detail. They can build data pipelines that react near real-time to changes in Finance and Operations data.A change feed once written to a data lake is never modified or deleted. Customers can use the change feed to audit data changes within Finance and Operations apps as well.See alsoChange data in Azure Data Lake (docs)

For example changes to a customer address or a store channel configuration. The data export updates cause a performance impact on the environments as the core retail transaction entities aren't changed and in general retail transactions entities rarely change after their initial creation.In Commerce versions 10.0.21 and later if a user enables change tracking in the Data Management Framework for any of the retail transaction-related entities listed the user can not select the option to enable change tracking for the entire entity or the primary table. Instead only the enable custom query option configuration is available. The custom query option will ensure that change tracking will only be triggered by changes to core retail transaction tables and not by changes to other tables that have a reference relationship to the retail transaction table.If an organization already has change tracking enabled for any of the retail transaction entities listed above and they are configured with the Enable entire entity or Enable primary table configuration upgrading to Commerce version 10.0.21 will not immediately change the change tracking configuration for these entities. Upgrading to Commerce version 10.0.21 should not cause any regression or negative impact to an existing data export configuration on any of the tables listed.After upgrading to Commerce version 10.0.21 if a user enables change tracking on a retail transaction-related entity for the first time or if they disable change tracking on an existing retail transaction entity and then later try to re-enable change tracking for that entity the user will no longer be able to turn on change tracking at the entire entity or primary table level and only the enable custom query option will be available.Organizations can modify the DefaultCTQuery method to extend the customer query and add additional tables to the query if needed.

Delay exact price calculation for orders and quotes to improve performance,Delay exact price calculation for orders and quotes to improve performance,null,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/delay-exact-price-calculation-orders-quotes-improve-performance,,,Sep 2021,Oct 2021,Dynamics 365 Commerce supports the creation of discounts such as mix-and-match threshold and quantity discounts (multiline discounts). These discounts are applied when more than one sales line on the sales order or sales quote combine and become eligible for the discount. Whenever a new line is added to the order the pricing engine evaluates the entire cart to determine whether any of these discounts can be applied. As the sales order gets larger adding a new line gets slower. It's common for B2B companies and some B2C companies to have large order sizes and therefore taking orders can become time consuming. This feature allows organizations to delay the price and discount calculation as a means to improving performance.Feature details,With this feature organizations can configure Commerce to delay the exact price and discount calculation for a sales order or sales quote as it's being created or edited in a call center. If the feature is enabled the pricing engine only considers the sales line that is being added or edited and ignores the other sales lines. In this case the net amount for an item includes the price calculation and simple discounts (for example discount percentage or amount off on an individual item) but the mix-and-match threshold and quantity discounts aren't applied. The user can select Recalculate Totals or Complete if they want an exact calculation while adding sales lines.
Save customer addresses asynchronously for sync and async customers,Save customer addresses asynchronously for sync and async customers,null,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/save-customer-addresses-asynchronously-sync-async-customers,,,Sep 2021,Oct 2021,Retail stores and e-commerce sites commonly capture a customer's shipping address. In a retail store the address is usually captured on the cashier's counter during checkout. Similarly on an e-commerce site a customer usually provides their shipping address during checkout. For any shopping channel it's important that the address capture is fast and reliable so that the customer can complete the checkout quickly. Any glitches during the checkout process can result in an abandoned cart or transaction. With this feature asynchronous customer address creation decouples the address creation to the availability of the headquarters app.Feature details,With this feature when a new address is saved on any customer profile from a point of sale (POS) or e-commerce site it will be saved asynchronously to the headquarters. That way the performance and reliability relating to saving customer addresses is improved. For both sync and async customers the address will be initially saved in the channel database and then will be synced to headquarters using the P-job and Synchronize customers and channel requests job. If this feature is enabled any number of customer addresses can be captured for async customers.

Typically these subsets of products are also negotiated for special prices. Accordingly business partner organizations want their business buyers to see and buy from only these contracted subsets of products from the B2B e-commerce website. This scenario is achieved by defining one or more business partner-specific catalog with products and prices as negotiated with the business partner. This feature will enable retailers to define business partner-specific catalogs with products and prices as negotiated with them. When logged into the site business partner users will only see the products and prices as defined in the catalog associated with their organization.The following capabilities are planned as part of this feature:Associate a default catalog to the e-commerce website.Associate one or multiple catalogs to the customer hierarchies associated with a business partner organization and set a default catalog.Associate a default catalog to the customers in the customer hierarchy.Render the e-commerce site with products as per the catalog associated with the customer that's logged in.Provide capability for a customer to change the default catalog to another valid catalog on the e-commerce site.

Enabling the worksheets to handle both physical inventory items such as chairs and non-inventory items such as services gives businesses a unified procurement process.Feature details,You can process non-inventory lines in much the same way as other types of items. If you use requisition and planning worksheets as the starting point for purchase orders in your procurement process you can manually enter lines for non-inventory items on the worksheets. Then when you create your purchase orders the non-inventory items will be included.

In this release wave we make it more efficient to use those features assisting the user and give more information during the process.Feature details,The Payment Reconciliation Journal has been improved with the following capabilities:Separate number series.Posting preview.Ability to reverse the G/L register posted through the Payment Reconciliation Journal.The Bank Reconciliation page has been enhanced with the following capabilities:Bank ledger entries are now filtered so only ledger entries after the statement's ending date are displayed making it simpler to get an overview.The layout of the test report has been cleaned up making it simpler to read. The report will also use the statement date as a filter for the G/L account as well as the bank account so that the focus is on the period being reconciled.When applying auto-matching the user can decide to not overwrite any of the already matched entries or to overwrite all.Many-to-1 matching is now possible so many bank statement lines can be matched against one bank ledger entry. This will support scenarios such as a bank statement splitting up sales into payment methods for which you only posted one bank ledger entry.When you transfer differences to be posted in a general journal the entries will be auto-matched when you return to the bank reconciliation reducing the redundant manual step.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Couple records between Business Central and Dataverse (and apps for Dataverse) in bulk,Couple records between Business Central and Dataverse (and apps for Dataverse) in bulk,null,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/couple-records-between-business-central-dataverse-apps-dataverse-bulk,,,Sep 1 2021,Oct 2021,When you integrate Business Central with Microsoft Dataverse or Dynamics 365 Sales both systems often already contain data. Because data in Dataverse can come from multiple sources there might be data that you don't want to transfer to Business Central because it could impact financial reports and other business processes such as invoicing and tax calculations. Bulk-coupling speeds up the process of coupling multiple records while letting you define rules to control how the couplings are made.Feature details,When you couple the records that you want to synchronize data for in each applicationfor example a customer in Business Central and an account in Dataverseyou can filter and choose the data to synchronize using the new Coupled in Dataverse column. To match and couple selected records between Business Central and Dataverse or Dynamics 365 Sales you use the Match-Based Coupling action.The Select Coupling Criteria page allows you to select the fields to match by choosing the Match on this Field column. You can also set a Matching Priority for fields and specify whether you want Business Central to create new records when a match isn't found by turning on the Create New If Unable to Find a Match toggle.Rather than writing custom business logic in a per-tenant extension to define how to match and couple records between Business Central and Dataverse or Dynamics 365 Sales you can define the fields to match on the Integration Field Mapping page for entire mapping.Business Central will use those settings to automatically match and couple records. Additionally this also makes it easier to migrate data from Business Central (on-premises) to Business Central online.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

You can now specify a default type for these documents and save a little time when preparing them.Feature details,Sales and purchase documents can contain different types of lines such as G/L Account Item Resource or Fixed Asset. In this release you can select the default line type that will be suggested when you create new documents. You can specify the default type for sales on the Sales &amp; Receivable Setup page and for purchases on the Purchase &amp; Payables Setup page in the Document Default Line Type field. Afterward the first line on the document will always use the default type that you specified and you can start working with lines by selecting values in the No. field. Of course you can change type in line if needed. If you do the next lines that you create will use type from the previous line.

For example you can use templates for journals make quick bulk edits and so on. Businesses can now use the feature to speed up data entry on recurring general journals and intercompany G/L journals.Feature details,The Edit in Excel feature has been around for a while on pages where businesses often bulk-edit data but to extend its availability even further we've added it to the following pages:Recurring general journalsIntercompany general journalsTell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

It's best to set up posting groups and dimensions up front. However many companies do that as they go and resolve issues as they arise. We've added tools that support learning by capitalizing on concrete examplesfor example when documents are using posting groups that are not set up correctly or have incorrect dimensions or dimension values. Accountants controllers and finance people know how specific transactions need to be posted and guidance when things go wrong with posting setups and dimensions will make it easier to resolve issues.Feature details,Product telemetry shows that posting groups and dimensions errors are typically caused by incorrect setup. We've made changes to clarify the errors and provide guidance on how to resolve them. You can now investigate issues with posting setups on the Error Messages page across the application:The Description column shows details about the error.The Source and Source Field Name columns point to the posting setup page where the error occurred and link to a page where you can resolve the issue. This requires the user to have permissions to do so.The Support URL column provides a link to a troubleshooting guide.Additionally for dimension issues the Error Messages page provides a link in the Context column that opens a page where you can fix the issues in the document. This also requires that the user has permissions to do so.NoteThe error handling described here is not available on Item Resource Employee and Fixed Asset Journals and for G/L accounts added in local versions of posting groups.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Occasionally there are situations where a business requires multiple records to be created synchronized or restored manually on an ad hoc basis. This feature decreases the number of synchronization jobs that are run in such cases making synchronization of multiple records faster and users more productive.Feature details,When users select multiple records such as hundreds of customers or contacts Business Central creates a single synchronization job per batch of selected records. This greatly reduces the load on the task scheduler that runs the background jobs and makes it easier for users to stay below the limits for queue entries. This new way of synchronizing batches of selected records also considers Dataverse request limits by ensuring that the batches are processed in smaller sizes.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

The ability to include the right level of detail on item variants in demand forecasts unlocks planning capabilities and reduces lead times for companies that don't have an inflow of sales orders and manage many nearly identical items.Feature details,Item variants are a great way to keep your list of items under control especially if you have a large number of items that are almost identical and vary for example only in color. Rather than setting up each variant as a separate item you can set up one item and then specify the various colors as variants of the item. In this release you can register anticipated demand not only with respect to locations and dates but with item variants as well.This unlocks planning capabilities for companies that don't have a steady inflow of sales orders and operate using large lists of almost identical items.We also plan to enable Edit in Excel for Demand Forecast Entries so that it's easier to create and update demand forecasts.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

When you need to update address information the structured approach that these services use may not always be what's right for some scenarios. Therefore Business Central now offers a more flexible means of entering address details.Feature details,You can set the Require Country/Region Code in Address by selecting this field on the General Ledger Setup page.

Because SKUs often contain important information about the items they're also valuable in production processes. You can leverage the information from SKUs by assigning them to production bills of material (BOMs) and routes. Additionally it's easy to update the BOM and route on SKUs. You can simply specify a BOM and route on an item and they will be assigned to the SKU.Feature details,We have increased the number of business processes that take into account the values in the Production BOM and Production Routing fields defined on SKUs. These include the following processes:Capable-to-promise called from sales orders.Planning worksheet including the Calculate Net Change Plan Calculate Regenerative Plan and Get Action Messages actions.Order planning.By default the Production BOM and Production Routing fields are available on SKUs.NoteWhen you create a SKU the production BOM and route are copied from the item to the SKU. If you have many SKUs but only one BOM or route it's easy to update your SKUs. Just remove the production BOM or production route on the SKUs and they'll use the default values from the items.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

That means it's important to be able to handle items in alternate units of measure depending on the process and accurately convert those measures to the base unit of measure.Feature details,You can specify a rounding precision for base units of measure to guide users on what to enter for a given business process and reduce rounding issues when using alternate units of measure.When an item serves different purposes you can set up alternate units of measure for it. The base unit of measure for the item defines how you store it and the alternate units of measure define how you handle it in purchase production or sales documents. For example you may buy the item on pallets and only use single pieces in production.When you use alternate units of measure the value in the Qty. per Unit of Measure field helps calculate the quantity in base unit of measure which can lead to rounding issues.For example you're receiving 1 box that contains 6 items from your supplier. When the items arrive at the warehouse you discover that 1 of the 6 items is missing. You decide not to post the receipt of 1 box but to change quantity to 5/6 pieces instead. That will be converted to a receipt of 4.99998 pieces. To receive a whole number the Quantity Rounding Precision field lets you specify a value that will for example convert the quantity to 5 pieces.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Integration between Business Central and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales now allows these services to exchange information about items in multiple units of measure.Feature details,When you enable the Feature Update: Multiple Units of Measure Synchronization with Dynamics 365 Sales feature in Feature Management Business Central will create unit groups for items and resources through the data update process.You can now view two new integration table mappings for Item Units of Measure (ITEM-UOM) and Resource Units Of Measure (RESOURCE-UOM).Item or resource unit groups automatically generate sets of units of measure for items and resources that match the units in Dynamics 365 Sales. On the Item Unit Group List or Resource Unit Group List pages you can view coupled unit groups by choosing the Unit Group action you can synchronize unit group data by using the Synchronize action and couple or delete unit groups by choosing Coupling Set up coupling or Delete coupling.From the Item Units of Measure and Resource Units of Measure pages for each units of measure in a unit group you can now view the coupled unit by choosing the Unit action use the Synchronize action to synchronize unit data or couple or delete a coupling by choosing Coupling Set up coupling or Delete coupling.NoteYou need to have the Feature Update: Multiple Units of Measure Synchronization with Dynamics 365 Sales feature enabled in Feature Management to use this capability.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

The role is however limited in some ways. Among these limitations is the ability to create job queue entries and set them as ready to run for customers. Job queue entries are important tools for setting up and configuring Business Central tenants. Delegated admins can create job queue entries and request approval from a licensed user.Feature details,Business Central provides the delegated admin role so that people who are not employed by the customer typically Microsoft partners can set up and configure business processes for the customers. The delegated admin role is not however a licensed user in Business Central and often is only assigned temporarily so there are some limitations to what they can do. For example delegated admins cannot set up tasks that might be run after the delegated admin relationship has been revoked such as job queue entries.That has been problematic because job queue entries are useful tools for running setup and configuration processes in Business Central and delegated admins need to be able to create and run them in their customer's tenant. In this release delegated admins can create job queue entries and set them as ready to run. Then a licensed user from the customer can start the job queue entry to complete the process that the delegated admin created.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

In this release we have increased coverage of auto-generated documentation for the AL language ensuring that this is in sync with the latest changes and additions. Specifically we are adding properties triggers method options and method attributes.Feature details,AL reference documentation is used to look up documentation of types method and properties in the programming language. For many releases this documentation has been handcrafted which can lead to inconsistencies with the actual language. To ensure that the documentation is in sync with the language entries will be auto-generated and any additional content will be added manually afterward. This ensures full coverage and that the documentation better reflects the AL language as it evolves.

Until now apart from selected reactive telemetry allowing monitoring of customer tenants there has not been a proactive way to measure execution performance during development nor when troubleshooting specific customer support cases with performance issues. To address this we are introducing the ability to capture execution timing as part of a snapshot and investigate this in Visual Studio Code when replaying the snapshot.Feature details,Snapshot captures now include a performance profile of the executed code that is captured in the snapshot. Using a new performance profiling editor view in the AL Visual Studio Code extension developers can then investigate the time spent on execution either using top-down or bottom-up call stack views.

To enable force synchronization in online environments install and sync can now also be performed as one transactional operation per database available for PowerShell scripts on-premises.Feature details,As a prerequisite for force sync support of extensions in online environments the ability to install and sync extensions as one transaction per database has been added. This capability is also available on-premises so that you can choose to only install extensions that can also synchronize for example.See alsoAdministration of Business Central On-Premises (docs)

Buffer table has been at the center of localizations and partner customizations when changes to G/L posting are needed or when G/L entries need to be aggregated in a different way when they're posted to the general ledger. The previous design is not extensible because the primary key in that table cannot be changed without introducing breaking change across partner solutions and localizations. There are significant differences in this table across localizations in particular for APAC BE ES IT NA and RU and this has made it difficult to extract localizations to extensions.This refactoring makes the posting process for sales purchase and service transactions extensible and enables partners to change the way the posting algorithm aggregates G/L entriesfor example by specific document lines posting groups or the tax setup required by local legislation. Partners can replace customizations by using the interface for G/L invoice posting resolve legacy issues for the Invoice Post. Buffer table and use their own implementation of G/L invoice posting.We have removed the dependencies from the Invoice Posting Buffer table in the Base Application and built an Invoice Posting component with an interface and an extensible enum for the implementation setup.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

If enabling this an extension source will be available both for debug download (PTEs) and in symbols. Because of this many partners select not to share the source thereby also prohibiting debug leading to longer times to mitigate customer issues and challenges with providing alternatives for debugging a source.Feature details,For better control of source access more granular options will be provided. At this time implementation details are still being worked on. This could be solved by replacing the existing ShowMyCode property in the app.json file and enhancing it with more detailed optionsfor example AllowDebugSource AllowDownloadSource or AllowSymbolsSource.Thank you for your ideaThank you for submitting this idea.

Force sync of customer-specific extensions in online environments,Force sync of customer-specific extensions in online environments,null,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/force-sync-customer-specific-extensions-online-environments,,,Oct 2021,Oct 2021,Whenever the table schema is changed in a destructive way in an extension it can have a downstream impact for any depending extension and potentially block updates until the breaking changes have been fully resolved. Until now the process for handling destructive changes has been to implement them and then obsolete them in due time to allow a more seamless process.There can however sometimes be a need for making breaking changes. This can occur for example in cases where there is no downstream impact of the change if dependencies are under full control (for example for per-tenant extensions) or to make changes that are forced by new clashing object identities introduced upstream.To help with these scenarios we are introducing the ability to deploy per-tenant extensions (PTEs) with force schema sync mode which will allow destructive changes to the table schema in the new extension version.Feature details,When deploying a new customer-specific (per-tenant) extension to Business Central online either through the Extension Management page or the admin center it will now be possible to force any destructive table schema changes and circumvent the usual error when such changes are detected. This will allow the removal of specific tables or fields from the database.NoteThis operation means you will lose any data that is stored in the removed tables and fields. You will still have the option to restore the database. Thus before a force sync in a production environment this should be thoroughly tested in a matching sandbox environment container or on-premises installation.

Just use the new keyword IncludedColumns in the key definition to create indexes with included columns on the leaf nodes.Benefits of indexes with included columns are:Included columns do not count against the 16 fields in an index definition.An index with included columns require less I/O on the database.An index with included columns is smaller and more likely to be cached in the database cache.

Just use the new keyword Columnstore in the table definition.A migration path from tables with SIFT indexes to NCCIs could be:Add all SIFT fields to the NCCI.Remove the SIFT index.If the SIFT indexes are really needed add them again using a per-tenant extension.Using NCCIs can give you better performance especially in situations where developers forget to add one or more SIFT indexes.

To help resolve such diagnostic issues an option of adding a URL for additional documentation on what is causing the issue and options for how to resolve the issue will now be available. Note that this feature adds the ability to include a URL; however not all diagnostic messages will take advantage of this from the beginning.Feature details,Having links in diagnostic messages from compilation or code analyzers will support linking to additional relevant documentation about the cause of the issue as well as options for how to resolve it.

In such cases the update of the main app will probably stop until the dependencies are updated or installed which adds steps that can slow the update process. In this release we're introducing an option that lets admins review dependencies before updating and automate any steps that are needed.See alsoManaging Updates in the Business Central Admin Center (docs)
