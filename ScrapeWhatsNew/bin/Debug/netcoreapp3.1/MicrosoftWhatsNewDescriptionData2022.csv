Or you might have multiple journeys that logically function together. These scenarios can now be accomplished easily with Dynamics 365 Marketing by using custom event triggers as the glue between journeys as well as between journeys and your custom processes.For example a loan application journey could have various steps that require a human agents approval. By creating a separate customer journey or Power Automate Flow for loan exception approval you can trigger it from various points in the loan application journeys where exceptions can occur. The data you send with the event trigger can be used for populating dynamic content or as inputs to other flow actions.,A new journey tile will raise an event trigger at any point in a customer journey.Any journey or Power Automate flows connected to the event trigger will be run immediately when a customer reaches the tile. This includes event triggers used in exit criteria goals and if/then branches for journeys.Logically connect two or more journeys using custom event triggers. For instance when a welcome journey for a new customer ends add them to the ongoing nurture journey.When using this action you can choose what data to send as part of the event trigger. You can choose customer profile data (for instance attributes of the target audience such as contacts and leads) and data from other event triggers used in the journey (for instance attributes of the event trigger that starts the journey).  NoteThis feature is only available in real-time marketing; it does not affect outbound marketing functionality.,CE

Each of these interactions such as a service ticket being closed represents an opportunity to engage more deeply with your customers. Now data no longer has to remain siloed within separate apps and out of reach of your customer engagement or marketing automation tools.,When you use Dynamics 365 applications all of your customer data and interactions are already being captured in Microsoft Dataverse. Some of this data captures moments where youd like to engage your customers through a journeyfor instance a support case that is created or a new order placed. You can now create event triggers to capture these moments that matter and then use these event triggers to start and drive journeys.  Create new event triggers based on common operations such as adding new rows to a table or updating attribute values on any audience table in Dataverse such as contact opportunity account and lead with an easy-to-use UI.Trigger journeys based on one or more specified conditions on any Dataverse tables (including custom tables) that are directly related to the audience table.Immediately use the trigger in journeys without requiring any development or integration.,CE

It provides visibility into future stock levels and can query the next available date for orders. This reduces the risks of losing sales opportunities and overstocking on inventory (which can have cost impact). Most importantly it provides insights into foreseen potential stock disruptions and the opportunity to act against it.,Recalculate inventory based on a specified date and period  Retailers and manufacturers can check inventory for a specified day or ask for the next available dates for products which is especially useful to support online customer queries and bulk orders. ATP functionality lets you select a recalculation date or period when querying inventory on hand. It also lets you check availability when reserving or allocating products. Each time you select a recalculation date and submit a query the system performs an instance check and recalculates the latest inventory changes. The latest inventory information for the selected date or period (including transaction statuses (physical measures) and calculated measures) will be returned as the result of the query.  View future seven-day availability with rolling calculations  The system supports up to seven days of rolling calculations and updates of inventory data.,Finance and operations
Inventory allocation for the Inventory Visibility Add-in,Inventory allocation for the Inventory Visibility Add-in,,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/inventory-allocation-inventory-visibility-add-in,,,Mar 2022,Apr 2022,Businesses constantly experience fluctuating inventory levels especially when running a sales promotion or experiencing supply shortages. Inventory allocation lets you pre-allocate available inventory to make sure you can fulfill orders for key channels or accounts. It helps you meet service level agreements (SLAs) and fulfill commitments to important customers. With global visibility over your inventory allocations you can align your multichannel inventory control strategy across legal entities.,Inventory allocation allows you to set aside dedicated inventory to make sure you can fulfill your most profitable channels or customers. Without inventory allocation inventory is most typically fulfilled using a simple first come first served principle. Inventory Visibility gives you more control by allowing you to build virtual inventory pools that are created based on allocation rules and allocation objects. Allocation objects are dimensions you can use to subgroup available inventory within a physical inventory location.  You can use virtual inventory pools for preallocating (ringfencing) a portion of inventory for your most profitable channels or customers. Front-end systems can submit queries to Inventory Visibility and can make soft reservations that respect the allocation objects dimensions. Inventory Visibility then finds the applicable allocation rule and responds with the available allocated inventory.  With the inventory allocation feature you can:  Set up inventory allocation receiver objects which can be based on channels locations customer groups or customized dimension. You can also create a hierarchical structure of allocation receivers.Restrict the actual consumption to allocated quantities. You can opt in for a hard check where if the allocated quantities are all consumed new demand requests posted by the same allocation receiver object will be rejected.Set up a fallback shared inventory pool. Inventory in the common pool is allocated for all channels and customers based on a first come first served principle. If a dedicated virtual pool is out of stock you can use the common pool to fulfill an order.,Finance and operations

With this enhancement the Inventory Visibility service calculates WHS-enabled items correctly regardless of which hierarchical level the items are stored in.,The Inventory Visibility Add-in supports on-hand quantity queries for WHS-enabled items regardless of whether each item has WHS-specific reservation operations (such as being reserved for WHS work at the WMS location level).  In the previous release Inventory Visibility didn't always correctly calculate on-hand inventory of WHS-enabled items and didn't include WHS reservation logic. For example suppose you had a WHS item stored at location A under warehouse 1 (where WHS management is enabled) created a sales order reserved a quantity of one for this order and then released the order to warehouse. Then you reserved a quantity of one at a WMS location for the sales order pick work. In this case Inventory Visibility would erroneously deduct two units from the total quantity because it didn't recognize the full warehouse hierarchy. With this enhancement inventory of reserved WHS-enabled items will be calculated just as accurately as for non-WHS items.,Finance and operations
Global Inventory Accounting Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management,Global Inventory Accounting Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management,,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/global-inventory-accounting-add-in-dynamics-365-supply-chain-management,,,Jun 18 2021,Apr 2022,International organizations are under increasing pressure from authorities to comply with local and global accounting standards. The valuation of inventory plays a significant role in securing compliance. The Global Inventory Accounting Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management provides the ability to account inventory in multiple representations by applying the appropriate valuation method (standard cost average or specific identification) and the selected accounting currency per instance. Global Inventory Accounting enables organizations to report inventory statements and subledger accounting values (also known as the inventory balance and the cost of goods sold) in what is often referred to as dual valuation or dual currency.,Organizations especially those with international operations often prefer to account for inventory by standard cost as part of their management accounting setup. However local governments tax authorities and the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS) typically don't recognize standard cost as an accounting principle and often require average or specific identification. In addition organizations often want to account inventory using a local currency and the functional currency.  Collectively these requirements must be addressed in a comprehensive solution that supports the ability to perform inventory accounting in multiple costing ledgers where each ledger can be configured with a specific set of accounting policies.  With this new functionality organizations can define as many costing ledgers as required. Inventory accounting in dual currencies and in dual valuations are both supported.  Inventory accounting is performed in individual ledgers. Several costing ledgers can be created for each legal entity in an organization as needed thereby ensuring that multiple inventory representations can be obtained. All documents (such as purchase orders sales orders transfer orders and so on) posted in a legal entity will be accounted in all the costing ledgers associated with that legal entity.  A costing ledger is defined by:  CalendarCurrencyExchange rate tableConvention  A convention is a collection of inventory accounting policies that can be associated to one or more ledgers. This provides the ability to share a common convention in the organization.  The Global Inventory Accounting Add-in supports multiple inventory accounting policies. For each policy a single rule can be selected and it applies to all products.Supported cost object policy options:  ProductProduct  SiteProduct  Site  Warehouse  Supported input measurement basis policy options:  Normal historicalStandard  Supported cost flow assumption policy options:  AverageSpecific identification (batch)Cost element policy  Supported recording interval:  Perpetual  This solution provides a detailed audit trail which ensures that you can track inventory accounting events and measurements all the way back to the original document posted in Supply Chain Management.  The solution leverages Power BI to provide insights and analytics. The shared asset library of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services provides a specially designed Power BI template that you can download and embed into Supply Chain Management.

For example a scale could be used to weigh material to determine the amount that goes into a production process. To ensure full material traceability these organizations also need to register which batch numbers are consumed by the production processes.  Workers can now use the Register material consumption flow on the Warehouse Management mobile app to register quantities of material consumed for a production or batch order and to register the batch and serial numbers for those materials as needed.  When registering material consumption inventory records on the scale unit are updated without requiring a round trip to the hub. This ensures that inventory information for the material always stays current and available to other production orders or processes. This capability also ensures these processes can run without interruption even if the connection between the hub and scale unit is lost.  An open API for registering material consumption is also provided. This is beneficial for organizations that want to integrate with a third-party manufacturing execution system (MES) that records the weight and tracking dimensions of consumed materials.

Demand Driven Material Requirements Planning (DDMRP),Demand Driven Material Requirements Planning (DDMRP),,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/demand-driven-material-requirements-planning-ddmrp,,,Jul 2022,Sep 2022,A growing number of companies want to control their supply chain based on Demand Driven Material Requirements Planning (DDMRP) principles. This typically yields inventory reductions of 30-45 percent while improving customer service. With this release the Planning Optimization Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management fully supports the DDMRP principles. With native DDMRP support in Planning Optimization customers can benefit from DDMRP supply chain optimization without the need for any external solutions.,DDMRP is a formal multi-echelon planning and execution method for protecting and promoting the flow of relevant information through the establishment and management of strategically placed decoupling point stock buffers. DDMRP combines aspects of Material Requirements Planning (MRP) and Distribution Requirements Planning (DRP) with the pull and visibility emphases found in Lean and the Theory of Constraints and the variability reduction emphasis of Six Sigma. These elements are successfully blended through key points of innovation in the DDMRP method. DDMRP is the supply-order generation and management engine of a Demand Driven Operating Model (DDOM). DDMRP can best be summarized as &quot;position protect and pull.&quot;  The five sequential components of DDMRP  DDMRP has five sequential components:  Strategic inventory positioning: Determines where the decoupling points are placed.Buffer profiles and levels: Determine the amount of protection at those decoupling points.Dynamic adjustments: Define how the level of protection flexes up or down based on operating parameters market changes or planned or known future events.Demand-driven planning: The process by which supply orders (purchase orders manufacturing orders and stock transfer orders) are generated.Visible and collaborative execution: The process by which a DDMRP system manages open supply orders.  The first three components essentially define the initial and evolving configuration of a DDMRP model. The final two elements define the day-to-day operation of the method. DDMRP is typically the start of an organization's transformation to a demand-driven adaptive enterprise.    Main components of the DDMRP offering for Planning Optimization  The DDMRP offering for Planning Optimization includes the following main components:  Inventory positioning: Enable companies to calculate and identify the decoupled lead time (DLT) for purchased distributed and manufactured items.Buffer profiles: Group items into independently managed families with variable settings for zone impact. Calculate DDMRP buffers and zone values using a combination of buffer profile attributes and the individual part traits of usage lead time and order minimum.Dynamic buffer adjustments: Dynamically altering buffers for planned or anticipated events. Maintained as minimum re-order point and maximum.Demand-driven planning:Perform the DDMRP net flow equation including qualifying sales order demand (due today past due and qualified spikes).Display net flow status (color percentage and quantity) for easy prioritization and supply order generation.All elements of the net flow equation are visible on the planner workbench.Highly visible and collaborative execution: Display alerts based on buffer status for on-hand position.

This feature enables planners to run filtered master planning for selected produced items which avoids the need to run without a filter to include related items. Automatic filtering ensures that Planning Optimization has all the information required to calculate the correct result which must include all products that have any relation to products in the entire bill of materials (BOM) structure of the planned order. Dependent child items are automatically detected and included during master planning with Planning Optimization. For example if a single bolt from the BOM structure of product A is also used to produce product B then all products in the BOM structures of products A and B will be included in the filter.

However because of time lags in the process from posting to actual payment there is often a mismatch between the transaction amount and the posted amount. This feature addresses the issue with foreign currency payments related to expense transactions.,When creating an expense report with foreign currency for an employee the system converts the value of that foreign currency to the legal entity currency using the exchange rate taken on the day the expense report was created. After several days when the customer tries to make a payment back to the employee or vendor the system converts the amount to be paid using the exchange rate on that day. This results in a difference in the amount between the expense report and the amount paid. Because of this issue the employee or vendor is either underpaid or overpaid requiring manual intervention to settle correctly. With this feature we aim to address the discrepancy with foreign currency payments related to expense transactions.,Finance and operations

To help avoid accidental deletion of general ledger (G/L) accounts this release wave adds an extra check.,To delete G/L accounts you must first balance the account to zero. Then you must close the fiscal year for any entries. The Check G/L Acc. Deletion After field is checked to see if there are ledger entries in the account after this date in which case it's likely not to be deleted. The user can still proceed to delete if they need to.  In this release wave we introduce an extra safeguard against accidental deletion of G/L accounts even in the scenarios where the criteria are met.  A new field Block Deletion of G/L Accounts is added to the General Ledger Setup page. The field acts as an extra validation when a user tries to delete an account where there are ledger entries after the date that is specified in the Check G/L Acc. Deletion After field.  When the Block Deletion of G/L Accounts field is set to Yes you cannot delete G/L accounts that have ledger entries after the date in the Check G/L Acc. Deletion After field. In order to delete such an account a user with access to the General Ledger Setup page must first set this field to No. Then the account can be deleted.  We recommend setting the Block Deletion of G/L Accounts field to Yes. We also recommend that you always have a date set in the Check G/L Acc. Deletion After field such as the time you're required to store your finance data.

Standardizing the bank reconciliation process in North American versions,Standardizing the bank reconciliation process in North American versions,,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/standardizing-bank-reconciliation-process-north-american-versions,,,Mar 2022,Apr 2022,Bank reconciliation in North American versions is now done through the standard Bank Reconciliation page which has been improved to support the same tasks as the Bank Rec. Worksheet did in those versions. The Bank Rec. Worksheet page that was specific to North American versions will be removed in April 2023.,Bank reconciliation in the North American (NA) versions for the United States Canada and Mexico can be done either through the standard Bank Reconciliation page or with the Bank Rec. Worksheet page which was missing some of the newer features that the Bank Reconciliation page offers. To standardize the bank reconciliation process we have modified the Bank Reconciliation page added a feature for deposits that is the same as we provide for the NA version today and added capabilities to allow users to reconcile deposits.  In addition header and footer fields help ensure that users have the same overview of outstanding checks and payments as they had in the NA versions. The Bank Statement Report (posted bank reconciliations) is improved to show more detailed information on the G/L balance and outstanding checks and payments than the current NA version of the Test reports. The standard version of the Test report is improved accordingly.  In the standard side-by-side bank reconciliation all users can import bank statements (.csv files) use automatic matching post and reconcile deposits and get a better overview of related data during bank reconciliation through on-page information such as a test report as well as a more audit-friendly report for posted bank reconciliations.  In April 2023 users must use the Bank Reconciliation page for bank reconciliations. The Bank Rec. Worksheet will no longer be available.  Users who have performed bank reconciliations using the Bank Rec. Worksheet page will still be able to review their posted bank reconciliations and print reports for them.  By default the Bank Reconciliation page is turned on. To turn on the Bank Rec. Worksheet page and use it instead you can open the General Ledger Setup page and turn on the Bank Recon. With Auto. Match toggle.  The following pages and reports are marked as Obsolete in this release:  PAG 10120 Bank Rec. WorksheetREP 10407 Bank Rec. Test ReportREP 10406 Bank Rec.

Support inventory pick and warehouse pick operations for jobs,Support inventory pick and warehouse pick operations for jobs,,,,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/support-inventory-pick-warehouse-pick-operations-jobs,,,Mar 2022,Apr 2022,Enable internal warehouse activities for jobs to ensure an effective flow through the warehouse and to organize and maintain company inventories.,The warehouse activity of picking items before they are consumed is performed in different ways depending on how warehouse management features are configured. The complexity can rank from no warehouse features through basic warehouse configurations for order-by-order handling in one or more activities to advanced configurations where all warehouse activities must be performed in a directed workflow.  If you decide to organize and record your picking activity with warehouse documents you choose the Require Pick field on the Location Card page. This field specifies whether you must perform pick activities in the warehouse at this location.  NoteAlthough the setting is called Require Pick you can still post consumption directly from the job journal line at the location. If your location is set up to require pick processing but not shipment processing you use the Inventory Pick page to organize and print the picking information and enter and post the result of the pick which in turn posts the consumption of the items.If your location is set up to require both pick and shipment processing meaning that you have chosen both the Require Pick and Require Shipment fields on the Location Card page you use the Warehouse Pick page to handle the pick. The warehouse pick functions similarly to the inventory pick except that instead of posting the picking information you register the pick. This registration process does not post the consumption but merely makes the items available for post. As a warehouse manager you can use a pick worksheet to organize pick information before creating the individual warehouse pick instructions.

For example if a customer changes their mind about the product or quantity they ordered in Dynamics 365 Sales such changes can be automatically processed in Business Central by archiving the sales document and creating new one. The same is true for changes in Business Centralfor example when prices tax amounts or expected shipment dates change the changes are automatically synchronized to Dynamics 365 Sales. That helps keep your sellers up to date with the latest changes and the status of quotes and orders.  The Integration Table Mappings page contains new mappings for sales quote and order header and lines. When setting up the initial connection for Dynamics 365 Sales active quotes and orders can be synched between Business Central and Dynamics 365 Sales using Full Synchronization or Match-based coupling.  NoteThis feature and existing sales order integrations are mutually exclusive. You can use one or the other but not both.

Controllers can define policies for posting these non-standard transactions and accountants can change them during posting.,You can enable alterations of default customer or vendor posting groups by choosing Allow Alteration of Posting Group on the Sales and Receivable Setup and Service Mgt. Setup pages for customer posting group changes and the Purchases and Payables Setup page for vendor posting group changes.  On the Customer Posting Groups or Vendor Posting Groups pages you can specify the posting groups to allow as substitutes by choosing Substitutions. Substitute posting groups can replace the default customer or vendor posting group specified for a customer or vendor.  After you set this up you can pick among allowed substitute posting groups and change customer or vendor posting group when posting sales or purchase documents and journals. Changed non-default customer or vendor posting groups are copied to posted documents and journals and payable or receivable G/L entries are posted to the G/L accounts specified for the substitutes.  When applying for example an invoice and payment that are posted to with different customer or vendor posting groups (different G/L accounts) Business Central transfers amounts between the G/L accounts to balance them.  A Suggest Vendor Payments report can now also be run using Vendor Posting Group as criteria for suggesting payments.

In this release wave we are going to empower functional developers/consultants as well as customer administrators and power users to capture a user flow from within the web client and view high-level information about time spent in the web client. This way people can investigate which involved extensions consume the most time including top-consuming method calls for example.,In 2021 release wave 2 we added the AL performance profiler to the Visual Studio Code AL experience. The performance profiler has empowered pro developers to investigate performance as part of developing new functionality as well as help troubleshoot performance issues in AL code in customer environments even in production.  In 2022 release wave 1 we are going to take this even further. Having this tool will make it easy for consultants and customer administrators to seamlessly perform initial performance investigations without involving pro developers to be able to pinpoint performance issues and file support cases to the most likely owners of the app be that a per-tenant extension an AppSource app or the Dynamics 365 Business Central core app. It will also be possible to share the resulting capture making it faster for a pro developer to do further analysis without having to perform a repro of the issue locally.  The in-client performance profiler will be a new app page that can be reached on its own or from the Help &amp; Support page. It will contain actions to start and stop the capture of a user flow. You will be able to see the performance results of a capture including time spent per involved extension top method calls and other metrics. Youll also be able to download the capture so that you can share it with technical support or a pro developer. Note that the rules of GDPR apply to this. The page can be opened in another browser window side-by-side with the user experience that you want to profile so that you can make sure the capture is as concise as possible and only contains the relevant steps.
