Collaborate throughout the work order lifecycle with embedded Microsoft Teams,Collaborate throughout the work order lifecycle with embedded Microsoft Teams,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>Field service organizations are geographically dispersed between dispatch centers customer service centers and customer locations. However collaboration is critical to ensure an optimal outcome for customers. The work order process requires collaboration between customer service agents dispatchers asset managers account representatives and multiple frontline workers. For example dispatchers constantly communicate with frontline workers to understand whether they are running on time with their current job so they can adjust the schedule accordingly. Collaboration has traditionally been a source of pain. At best when organizations have a collaboration application people need to leave their workspace and open a separate application to communicate with their colleagues wasting valuable time that could be better spent helping customers. These conversations are not linked to the work order which means that as new stakeholders are brought in they are missing critical context about the work order.In other cases organizations do not provide a collaboration application which means people use their own private tools such as SMS and other chat applications. This exposes organizations to security risks and further disconnects conversations from the rest of the team.By embedding Microsoft Teams within the work order experience you can easily collaborate with your entire organization. And when enabled even external contacts such as customers and third-party subcontractors always keep the correct information in the work order context.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>With embedded Microsoft Teams collaboration into Field Service any user involved in the work order process can collaborate using Teams functionality while seeing all the critical contextual conversations to ensure an optimal outcome.Teams integration includes the following capabilities:Chat with colleagues from within the work order form even if the conversation is not related to the work order saving you from switching to the Microsoft Teams app whenever you need to chat. View your existing chats or initiate a new chat.Initiate a new chat with one or many colleagues and optionally link the chat to the work order.

Edge scale units to run distributed workloads at your facility,Edge scale units to run distributed workloads at your facility,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>By enabling you to run vertical functionality workloads at your facility edge scale units increase the resilience of supply chain business processes. You can run the same workloads that you run in your vertical cloud on the vertical edge. Microsoft provides out-of-the-box workloads for scale units that target processes in warehouse and manufacturing execution.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>Edge scale units represent the vertical edge in the distributed hybrid topology for supply chain management. They run on-premises on hardware located at your own facilities and thereby help to increase the resilience for critical operations in your supply chain.  Even if an edge scale unit is temporarily disconnected from the internet it will continue to run its configured workloads locally. Edge scale units also allow direct integration with other local systems without connecting through the cloud.Scale units whether in the cloud or on the edge always run under the umbrella of your supply chain hub in the cloud and can run the same vertical workload functionality. You can therefore install any of the standard workloads for manufacturing or warehouse execution that Microsoft delivers and can also run custom workloads.With 2021 release wave 2 organizations gain the ability to deploy edge scale units using either custom-selected hardware or recommended Azure Stack appliances located at their facility. You can choose to manage your supply chain management workloads yourself or with a partner. Options include:Custom hardware layouts which give your organization complete control over your edge unit hardware. Your own IT department selects and maintains the hardware exactly as required by your organization. The only restriction is that your solution must fulfil the hardware requirements for on-premises deployments.Azure Stack appliance which provides an integrated hardware and software solution built by trusted hardware partners and delivered ready to use straight to your datacenter.See alsoDeploy edge scale units on custom hardware using LBD (docs)</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/edge-scale-units-run-distributed-workloads-at-facility,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/edge-scale-units-run-distributed-workloads-at-facility,,,Apr 23 2021,Nov 2021

For example a scale could be used to weigh material to determine the amount that goes into a production process. To ensure full material traceability these organizations also need to register which batch numbers are consumed by the production processes.Workers can now use the Register material consumption flow on the Warehouse Management mobile app to register quantities of material consumed for a production or batch order and register the batch and serial numbers for those materials as needed.When registering material consumption inventory records on the scale unit are updated without requiring a round trip to the hub. This ensures that inventory information for the material always stays current and available to other production orders or processes. This capability also ensures these processes can run without interruption even if the connection between the hub and scale unit is lost.An open application programming interface (API) for registering material consumption is also provided. This is beneficial for organizations that want to integrate with a third-party manufacturing execution system (MES) that records the weight and tracking dimensions of consumed materials.Start production and batch ordersProduction and batch orders that have a status of Started allow material consumption and finished goods to be reported. A dedicated flow called Start on the Warehouse Management mobile app enables workers to start a production or batch order. You can set up rules that automatically consume the planned amount of material for each production order (this process is also known as pre-flushing).It is now possible to use the Start flow on a Warehouse Management mobile app that is running against a scale unit. This capability ensures that workers can still start a production order and report material consumption and finished goods even if the connection between the hub and scale unit is lost.An open API for registering production start is also provided. This is beneficial for organizations that want to integrate with a third-party MES that provides the start signal.For more information about the benefits of using scale units see Cloud and edge scale units for manufacturing and warehouse management workloads.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/enhanced-manufacturing-execution-workloads-scale-units,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/enhanced-manufacturing-execution-workloads-scale-units,,,Nov 2021,Dec 2021

Global Inventory Accounting Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management,Global Inventory Accounting Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>International organizations are under increasing pressure from authorities to comply with local and global accounting standards. The valuation of inventory plays a significant role in securing compliance. Global Inventory Accounting provides the ability to account inventory in multiple representations by applying the appropriate valuation method (standard cost average or specific identification) and the selected accounting currency per instance. Global Inventory Accounting enables organizations to report inventory statements and subledger accounting values (also known as the inventory balance and the cost of goods sold) in what is often referred to as dual valuation or dual currency.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>Organizations especially those with international operations often prefer to account for inventory by standard cost as part of their management accounting setup. However local governments tax authorities and the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS) typically don't recognize standard cost as an accounting principle and often require average or specific identification. In addition organizations often want to account inventory using a local currency and the functional currency.Collectively these requirements must be addressed in a comprehensive solution that supports the ability to perform inventory accounting in multiple costing ledgers where each ledger can be configured with a specific set of accounting policies.With this new functionality organizations can define as many costing ledgers as required. Inventory accounting in dual currencies and in dual valuations are both supported.Inventory accounting is performed in individual ledgers. Several costing ledgers can be created for each legal entity in an organization as needed thereby ensuring that multiple inventory representations can be obtained. All documents (such as purchase orders sales orders transfer orders and so on) posted in a legal entity will be accounted in all the costing ledgers associated with that legal entity.A costing ledger is defined by:CalendarCurrencyExchange rate tableConventionA convention is a collection of inventory accounting policies that can be associated to one or more ledgers. This provides the ability to share a common convention in the organization.The Global Inventory Accounting Add-in supports multiple inventory accounting policies. For each policy a single rule can be selected and it applies to all products.Supported cost object policy options:ProductProduct  SiteProduct  Site  WarehouseSupported input measurement basis policy options:Normal historicalStandardSupported cost flow assumption policy options:AverageSpecific identification (batch)Cost element policySupported recording interval:PerpetualThis solution provides a detailed audit trail which ensures that you can track inventory accounting events and measurements all the way back to the original document posted in Supply Chain Management.The solution leverages Power BI to provide insights and analytics.

Park tasks in the Warehouse Management mobile app,Park tasks in the Warehouse Management mobile app,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>Increase the efficiency of warehouse workers by allowing them to stop their current task to perform another more important one and then return to the original task without losing any information.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>Workers using the Warehouse Management mobile app can temporarily pause the current task. They can then start and complete another important task before safely returning where they left off with the previous work.For example a warehouse worker performing a sales picking flow might arrive at a specified location only to find that the required item is no longer present. Previously the only option would be to abandon the current pick flow and do an item inquiry to find out if more of that item is available at some other location. As a result the worker would lose their sales pick information and run the risk that another worker might grab and restart that same picking work thus creating inefficiencies. With this feature the worker can instead park the current task and go to a secondary flow (the item inquiry flow) to find a new location that contains the item replenish the location and then continue the sales pick work. This means that no information is lost and the warehouse pick work is more efficient.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/park-tasks-warehouse-management-mobile-app,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/park-tasks-warehouse-management-mobile-app,,,Oct 2021,Dec 2021
Inventory allocation for the Inventory Visibility Add-in,Inventory allocation for the Inventory Visibility Add-in,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>Inventory allocation allows you to set aside dedicated inventory to make sure you can fulfill your most profitable channels.Inventory levels constantly fluctuate especially when you are running a sales promotion or are experiencing supply shortages. Inventory allocation lets you pre-allocate available inventory to make sure you can fulfill orders for key channels or key accounts. It helps you meet service level agreements (SLAs) and fulfill commitments to your key customers.By providing global visibility over your inventory allocations this feature helps you align your multi-channel inventory control strategy across legal entities.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>Without inventory allocation inventory is most typically fulfilled using a simple first come first served principle. Inventory Visibility gives you more control by allowing you to build virtual inventory pools that are created based on allocation rules and allocation objects. Allocation objects are dimensions you can use to subgroup available inventory within a physical inventory location.Virtual inventory pools let you pre-allocate (ringfence) a portion of inventory for your most profitable channels or customers. Front-end systems can submit queries to Inventory Visibility and can make soft reservations that respect the allocation objects dimension. Inventory Visibility then finds the applicable allocation rule and responds with the available allocated inventory.With the inventory allocation feature you can:Set up inventory allocation objects which can be based on channels sales origin or customer groups. You can also create a hierarchical structure of allocation objects.Use allocate rules to define how inventory should be allocated on the location level. Each allocation rule contains the logic used to establish an inventory pool and the reserved inventory can be calculated as a fixed quantity or a percentage of the available inventory.Set up a fallback shared inventory pool. Inventory in the common pool is allocated for all channels and customers. If a dedicated virtual pool is out of stock you can use the common pool to fulfill the order.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/inventory-allocation-inventory-visibility-add-in,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/inventory-allocation-inventory-visibility-add-in,,,Jan 2022,Mar 2022

This feature can also help reduce the need to reset forgotten passwords.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>Users of the production floor execution interface and users of the time and attendance functionality can sign in using face recognition instead of by scanning or keying in a personal badge ID.Workers start by selecting the sign-in button in the interface which opens a page where they can activate the device camera. The system recognizes when a worker is looking into the camera and then launches the face-recognition process. If the system recognizes the face the worker is successfully signed in. In this release the worker needs to make two touch interactions to sign in. In a future release we plan to introduce a touchless sign-in experience.Admins need to configure the connection to the face recognition service by entering an application key. Admins can also define worker groups based for example on each worker's shift or work area.Each worker must set themselves up to use the face recognition service. Workers open a setup page on the production floor execution interface where they can select a button and have their pictures taken by the device camera. The system generates a face map which is a mathematical model that describes the unique elements of a worker's face. The system doesn't store the photo just the face map.The system is designed to protect worker privacy.

Planning Optimization support for capability-based resource allocation,Planning Optimization support for capability-based resource allocation,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>Companies using Planning Optimization can optimize resource usage by deferring resource allocation until productions are scheduled. This flexible solution automates resource selection during production scheduling based on individual operation capabilities and requirements.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>Planning Optimization now supports production scheduling with flexible resource allocation based on resource capabilities. A capability is the ability of an operations resource to perform a particular activity. An operations resource can have more than one capability assigned to it and a capability can be assigned to more than one resource. Capabilities can be assigned to all types of resources including tools vendors machines locations facilities and human resources. Each capability can be set to ensure the selected resource has the required capability level for a given operation. Capabilities can also include a priority which is used during scheduling to optimize the resource selection based on highest available priority.Instead of assigning specific resources or resource groups to a route operation you can define the capabilities required for each route operation. With this setup scheduling will match the required capabilities with the capabilities of available resources to determine the resource assignment for each production job.Capability-based resource allocation is part of the materials resource planning II (MRP II) support provided by Planning Optimization. MRP II helps planners at manufacturing companies control their production schedule control resource load and determine delivery lead times. Because Planning Optimization runs as a separate service it's able to facilitate high performance production planning without slowing down the rest of the system.With Planning Optimization support for production scheduling manufacturers can benefit from:Significantly improved performance and scalability with in-memory processing.Minimized system impact on other processes made possible by moving master planning to its own service.Near-real-time insights into requirement changes during office hours.For more information about the Planning Optimization migration process including answers to frequently asked questions see Migration to Planning Optimization for master planning.Geographic areasThis feature will be released into the following Microsoft Azure geographic areas:United StatesEuropeUnited KingdomAustraliaCanada</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planning-optimization-support-capability-based-resource-allocation,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planning-optimization-support-capability-based-resource-allocation,,,Sep 2021,Nov 2021

For example changes to a customer address or a store channel configuration. The data export updates cause a performance impact on the environments as the core retail transaction entities aren't changed and in general retail transactions entities rarely change after their initial creation.In Commerce versions 10.0.21 and later if a user enables change tracking in the Data Management Framework for any of the retail transaction-related entities listed the user can not select the option to enable change tracking for the entire entity or the primary table. Instead only the enable custom query option configuration is available. The custom query option will ensure that change tracking will only be triggered by changes to core retail transaction tables and not by changes to other tables that have a reference relationship to the retail transaction table.If an organization already has change tracking enabled for any of the retail transaction entities listed above and they are configured with the Enable entire entity or Enable primary table configuration upgrading to Commerce version 10.0.21 will not immediately change the change tracking configuration for these entities. Upgrading to Commerce version 10.0.21 should not cause any regression or negative impact to an existing data export configuration on any of the tables listed.After upgrading to Commerce version 10.0.21 if a user enables change tracking on a retail transaction-related entity for the first time or if they disable change tracking on an existing retail transaction entity and then later try to re-enable change tracking for that entity the user will no longer be able to turn on change tracking at the entire entity or primary table level and only the enable custom query option will be available.Organizations can modify the DefaultCTQuery method to extend the customer query and add additional tables to the query if needed.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/enforce-custom-query-change-tracking-configurations-retail-transaction-tables-due-performance-impacts,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/enforce-custom-query-change-tracking-configurations-retail-transaction-tables-due-performance-impacts,,,Aug 2021,Oct 2021

Couple records between Business Central and Dataverse (and apps for Dataverse) in bulk,Couple records between Business Central and Dataverse (and apps for Dataverse) in bulk,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>When you integrate your Business Central with Microsoft Dataverse or Dynamics 365 Sales both systems often already contain data. Because data in Dataverse can come from multiple sources there might be data that you don't want to transfer to Business Central because it could impact financial reports and other business processes such as invoicing and tax calculations. Bulk-coupling speeds up the process of coupling multiple records while letting you define rules to control how the couplings are made.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>When you couple the records that you want to synchronize data for in each applicationfor example a customer in Business Central and an account in Dataverseyou can filter and choose the data to synchronize. Rather than write custom business logic in a per-tenant extension to define how to match and couple records between Business Central and Dataverse or Dynamics 365 Sales you can define the fields to match in the integration field mapping page for whole mapping.To match and couple selected records between Business Central and Dataverse or Dynamics 365 Sales you can define the fields to match in the Select Coupling Criteria page for selected records.Select Coupling Criteria page allows you to select fields for which matching should be done by choosing the Match on this Field column. You can also set matching priority for fields selected for matching and whether Business Central should create new records if no match is found.Business Central will use those settings to automatically match and couple records. Additionally this also makes it easier to migrate data from Business Central (on-premises) to Business Central online.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Delegated admin can create job queue entries and request approval by a licensed user,Delegated admin can create job queue entries and request approval by a licensed user,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>The delegated admin role enables Microsoft partners to set up and manage certain aspects of Business Central on behalf of their customers. The role is however limited in some ways. Among these limitations is the ability to create job queue entries and set them as ready to run for customers. Job queue entries are important tools for setting up and configuring Business Central tenants. Delegated admins can create job queue entries and request approval from a licensed user.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>Business Central provides the delegated admin role so that people who are not employed by the customer typically Microsoft partners can set up and configure business processes for the customers. The delegated admin role is not however a licensed user in Business Central and often is only assigned temporarily so there are some limitations to what they can do. For example delegated admins cannot set up tasks that might be run after the delegated admin relationship has been revoked such as job queue entries.That has been problematic because job queue entries are useful tools for running setup and configuration processes in Business Central and delegated admins need to be able to create and run them in their customer's tenant. In this release delegated admins can create job queue entries and set them as ready to run. Then a licensed user from the customer can start the job queue entry to complete the process that the delegated admin created.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Improved user experience to keep posting setup and dimension issues from going wrong,Improved user experience to keep posting setup and dimension issues from going wrong,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>Posting groups and dimensions can be difficult concepts to understand. It's best to set up posting groups and dimensions up front. However many companies do that as they go and resolve issues as they arise. We've added tools that support learning by capitalizing on concrete examplesfor example when documents are using posting groups that are not set up correctly or have incorrect dimensions or dimension values. Accountants controllers and finance people know how specific transactions need to be posted and guidance when things go wrong with posting setups and dimensions will make it easier to resolve issues.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>Product telemetry shows that posting groups and dimensions errors are typically caused by incorrect setup. We've made changes to clarify the errors and provide guidance on how to resolve them. You can now investigate issues with posting setups on the Error Messages page across the application:The Description column shows details about the error.The Source and Source Field Name columns point to the posting setup page where the error occurred and link to a page where you can resolve the issue. This requires the user to have permissions to do so.The Support URL column provides a link to a troubleshooting guide.Additionally for dimension issues the Error Messages page provides a link in the Context column that opens a page where you can fix the issues in the document. This also requires that the user has permissions to do so.NoteThe error handling described here is not available on Item Resource Employee and Fixed Asset Journals and for G/L accounts added in local versions of posting groups.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Integrate Business Central and Microsoft Dataverse with more efficient synchronization of multiple records,Integrate Business Central and Microsoft Dataverse with more efficient synchronization of multiple records,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>The data exchanged between Business Central and Microsoft Dataverse is synchronized based on a schedule. Occasionally there are situations where a business requires multiple records to be created synchronized or restored manually on an ad hoc basis. This feature decreases the number of synchronization jobs that are run in such cases making synchronization of multiple records faster and users more productive.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>When users select multiple records such as hundreds of customers or contacts Business Central creates a single synchronization job per batch of selected records. This greatly reduces the load on the task scheduler that runs the background jobs and makes it easier for users to stay below the limits for queue entries. This new way of synchronizing batches of selected records also considers Dataverse request limits by ensuring that the batches are processed in smaller sizes.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Production BOMs and routes on stockkeeping units in planning scenarios,Production BOMs and routes on stockkeeping units in planning scenarios,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>Many businesses use stockkeeping units (SKUs) in their inventory management processes. Because SKUs often contain important information about the items they're also valuable in production processes. You can leverage the information from SKUs by assigning them to production bills of material (BOMs) and routes. Additionally it's easy to update the BOM and route on SKUs. You can simply specify a BOM and route on an item and they will be assigned to the SKU.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>We have increased the number of business processes that take into account the values in the Production BOM and Production Routing fields defined on SKUs.

Rounding for base unit of measure,Rounding for base unit of measure,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>You can assign a base unit of measure to items but sometimes items serve more than one purpose and are sold received or consumed in different measures in sales purchase and production processes. That means it's important to be able to handle items in alternate units of measure depending on the process and accurately convert those measures to the base unit of measure.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>You can specify a rounding precision for base units of measure to guide users on what to enter for a given business process and reduce rounding issues when using alternate units of measure.When an item serves different purposes you can set up alternate units of measure for it. The base unit of measure for the item defines how you store it and the alternate units of measure define how you handle it in purchase production or sales documents. For example you may buy the item on pallets and only use single pieces in production.When you use alternate units of measure the value in the Qty. per Unit of Measure field helps calculate the quantity in base unit of measure which can lead to rounding issues.For example you're receiving 1 box that contains 6 items from your supplier. When the items arrive at the warehouse you discover that 1 of the 6 items is missing. You decide not to post the receipt of 1 box but to change quantity to 5/6 pieces instead. That will be converted to a receipt of 4.99998 pieces. To receive a whole number the Quantity Rounding Precision field lets you specify a value that will for example convert the quantity to 5 pieces.Tell us what you thinkHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas providing suggestions and giving feedback.

Force sync of customer-specific extensions in online environments,Force sync of customer-specific extensions in online environments,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>Whenever the table schema is changed in a destructive way in an extension it can have a downstream impact for any depending extension and potentially block updates until the breaking changes have been fully resolved. Until now the process for handling destructive changes has been to implement them and then obsolete them in due time to allow a more seamless process.There can however sometimes be a need for making breaking changes. This can occur for example in cases where there is no downstream impact of the change if dependencies are under full control (for example for per-tenant extensions) or to make changes that are forced by new clashing object identities introduced upstream.To help with these scenarios we are introducing the ability to deploy per-tenant extensions (PTEs) with force schema sync mode which will allow destructive changes to the table schema in the new extension version.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>When deploying a new customer-specific (per-tenant) extension to Business Central online either through the Extension Management page or the admin center it will now be possible to force any destructive table schema changes and circumvent the usual error when such changes are detected. This will allow the removal of specific tables or fields from the database.NoteThis operation means you will lose any data that is stored in the removed tables and fields. You will still have the option to restore the database. Thus before a force sync in a production environment this should be thoroughly tested in a matching sandbox environment container or on-premises installation.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/force-sync-customer-specific-extensions-online-environments,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/force-sync-customer-specific-extensions-online-environments,,,Oct 2021,Oct 2021

For many releases this documentation has been handcrafted which can lead to inconsistencies with the actual language.

Profiling AL performance with snapshot debugger,Profiling AL performance with snapshot debugger,<h2>Business Value</h2> <p>Performance is top of mind for most customers especially in the world of online business. Until now apart from selected reactive telemetry allowing monitoring of customer tenants there has not been a proactive way to measure execution performance during development nor when troubleshooting specific customer support cases with performance issues. To address this we are introducing the ability to capture execution timing as part of a snapshot and investigate this in Visual Studio Code when replaying the snapshot.Feature details</p><h2>Feature details</h2> <p>Snapshot captures now include a performance profile of the executed code that is captured in the snapshot. Using a new performance profiling editor view in the AL Visual Studio Code extension developers can then investigate the time spent on execution either using top-down and bottom-up call stack views or flame graphs.</p>,,,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/profiling-al-performance-snapshot-debugger,,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/profiling-al-performance-snapshot-debugger,,,Aug 2021,Oct 2021
